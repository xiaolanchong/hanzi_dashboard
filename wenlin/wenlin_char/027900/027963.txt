From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 舌 (shé) 'tongue'. The right side was originally not 舌 shé 'tongue', but a now-defunct character made of 氐 over 口, pronounced guó, meaning "to hold in one's mouth". That component, now written 舌, also occurs in 话 huà 'speech' and 刮 guā 'scrape', etc. 舌 guó is phonetic in these characters, but in 活 huó it also makes sense as a signific: to drink the water of life, holding it in your mouth and swishing it around with your tongue.
