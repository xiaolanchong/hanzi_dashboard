派 ⁴pā char. 派司 pāsi
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 𠂢, which is supposed to be 永 yǒng 'forever' written backwards, depicting water flowing. The original meaning is "to branch off, like a river". The lower right part  under 𠂆 is coincidentally written the same as the lower right part of 旅 lǚ 'travel'.
Compare 哌 pài.
