==== 喦 [niè] many words (also see 嵒 yán)  [yì]
No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
From 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' tripled, joined by lines which look like 山 (shān) 'mountain'.
There is another character 嵒 yán (variant of 岩) 'rock' which looks the same, but the radical is 山. In some fonts the center stroke of 山 goes higher in 喦 niè than in 嵒 yán. (In Wenlin 3.0 the Hanyu Da Zidian references were accidentally reversed for 喦 and 嵒.)
