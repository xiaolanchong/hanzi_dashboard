1623 喬(S乔) [qiáo] (surname); 喬木 qiáomù arbor  [jiǎo]
喬[乔] ³qiáo {E} b.f. tall 乔木 qiáomù ◆char. 拿乔 náqiáo
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 乔:) The top is 夭 (yāo), depicting a person with the head bent. The bottom is 高 gāo 'tall', abbreviated.
Both 夭 and 高 suggest the meaning: something tall and leaning over at the top, like an arbor, or a bridge. 桥(橋) qiáo 'bridge' is etymologically the same word.
(Karlgren says that 高 gāo is phonetic, which seems dubious, but maybe 高 gāo and 乔 qiáo are cognates).
