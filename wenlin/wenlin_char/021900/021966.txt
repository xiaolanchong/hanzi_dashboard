嗎[吗] ⁵mǎ {E} char. 吗啡 mǎfēi
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 吗:) From 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' and 马(馬) mǎ ('horse') phonetic.
The component 口 occurs in several characters like 吗 ma, 呢 ne, 吧 ba, 啊 ā, etc., which represent spoken sounds rather than concepts, and in these cases the other component is generally purely phonetic.
