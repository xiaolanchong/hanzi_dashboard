---- 踵 [zhǒng] (书) heel; to follow close behind  [zhòng]
踵 ³zhǒng {E} b.f. ①heel 举踵 jǔzhǒng ②go in person 踵门道谢 zhǒngméndàoxiè ③follow; carry on 踵武 zhǒngwǔ
From ⻊(足 zú) 'foot' and 重 zhòng phonetic.
According to one theory (汉字大字典), the original form of 终 zhōng 'end' and 冬 dōng 'winter' (the end of the year) represented legs with the heels indicated, and that was also the character for 踵 zhǒng 'heel', the three words being cognate. But the modern character 踵 has nothing in common with 冬 or 终.
