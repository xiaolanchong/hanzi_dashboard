11   这(F這) [zhè] [zhèi] this
这[這] ¹zhè* {A} pr. this ◆adv. now
这[這] zhèi {E} pr. 〈coll.〉 this
From 言 yán 'words' (reduced to 文 wén in the simple form 这), and 辶(辵 chuò) 'go'.
Originally used for an obsolete word which meant 'go to meet', in which 言 yán was phonetic, then borrowed for the modern word zhè (for unknown reasons, says Karlgren). Compare 那 nà 'that'. 这 zhè and 那 nà have alternative pronunciations zhèi and nèi, used before a measure word especially in 北京 Běijīng, but it is more standard to stick to the readings zhè and nà all the time.
