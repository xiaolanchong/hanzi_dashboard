The modern character is composed of 艮 (gèn ☶) and 辶(辵 chuò) 'go'. However, the part that is now written 艮 was originally 日 (rì) 'sun' over 夂 (zhǐ) 'walk slowly' (a foot pointing downwards).
"夂 walk with difficulty in the 日 sunshine, 辶 a tautological addition; retire from the day; has nothing to do with 艮" --Karlgren.
退 tuì is phonetic in 腿 tuǐ 'leg'.
