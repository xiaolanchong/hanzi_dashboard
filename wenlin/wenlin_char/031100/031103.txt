(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 禄:) From 礻(示 shì) 'altar' and 录(彔) lù phonetic. According to one theory, 录 originates from a picture of a windlass or winch (辘轳 lùlu) drawing water for irrigation, which would symbolize good luck (protection of the harvest). 示 might have been added to emphasize the meaning 'good luck' (see 汉语大字典). The character 禄 can be found carved in good luck charms.
