The left side is 禾 (hé) 'grain', meaning harvest time. The right side is 火 (huǒ) 'fire', which might describe the grain's color, or burning the fields after the harvest.
"When 禾 the grain is 火 (heated through:) ripe" --Karlgren.
"The part now written as fire appears in several different guises in the oldest characters, and what it stands for remains uncertain" --Lindqvist.
