From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 主 zhǔ phonetic.
"To flow (as water); conduct water in a certain direction; fix one's attention or mind on; apply" --Karlgren.
Another character, 註, from 言 (yán) 'words' and 主 zhǔ, represented a different word zhù.
"To comment on, explain, commentary; annotate, make a note of, set forth, narrate; to sign, endorse" --Karlgren.
The meanings 'pay attention' and 'make a note' happening to be similar, 注 came to be used in place of 註. Among simple form characters only 注 occurs. Among full form characters, 註 still sometimes occurs in 註釋(注释) zhùshì 'explain', but 注 is used in 注音 zhùyīn 'phonetic notation'.
