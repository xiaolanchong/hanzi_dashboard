燭[烛] ³zhú {E} b.f. ①candle 蜡烛 làzhú* ②illuminate; light up 烛照 zhúzhào ◆m. watt
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 烛:) From 火 (huǒ) 'fire' and 蜀 shǔ ('silkworm') phonetic.
In the simple form 烛, the right side 蜀 is abbreviated to 虫 (chóng) 'insect'. Notice that insects are attracted to candles; also wax (蜡 là) is made by insects (bees).
