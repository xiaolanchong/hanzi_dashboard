---- 燼(S烬) [jìn] cinder; 灰燼 cinders, ashes
燼[烬] ⁷jìn {E} b.f. cinders 灰烬 huījìn
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 烬:) From 火 (huǒ) 'fire' and 尽(盡) jìn. Originally the character 盡 itself was used for the meaning 'ashes'. 盡 is composed of a phonetic component on top of 灬(火 huǒ) 'fire' and 皿 (mǐn) 'bowl'. When the character 盡 was borrowed for other meanings, the new character 燼 was created with the addition of another 火 (huǒ) 'fire' to represent the original meaning 'ashes'.
