From 纟(糸 sī) 'thread' and 冬 dōng 'winter'. Originally zhōng 'end' and dōng 'winter' (the end of the year) were both written with the same character, which represented a pair of legs with the heels (the ends) indicated (or a rope with knots at both ends); this has become 夂 in the modern writing.
冫(冰 bīng) 'ice' was added for 冬 'winter'. Then 糸 'thread' was added for 终 'end'.
