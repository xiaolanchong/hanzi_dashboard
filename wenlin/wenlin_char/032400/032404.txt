---- 纔 [cái] (variant of 才 cái 'then') [shān] (obsolete:) brown
才[-/纔] ¹cái* {A} adv. ①then and only then ②just now ③only (before a number) ④actually, very/more | Tā chàng de ∼ hǎo ne. 他唱得∼好呢。 Actually, she sang better (than sb. else).
From 糸 (sī) 'silk' and 毚 chán phonetic.
"Brown, dark colour; character for unknown reasons applied to and chiefly used for a word ...(cái)... barely, just; now, thereupon, then" --Karlgren(1923).
"The etymon ... 'sprout' is now differentiated into (1) 才 'talent', (2) 材 'material', (3) 財 'wealth', and (4) 纔 'just, then-and-only-then' ( < 'budding, beginning'). In the last meaning as an adverb, the more complicated character is popularly regarded as the 'correct' character and character 1 (才) is regarded as a 'simplified' loan character for 4 (纔), whereas actually character 1 (才) is the original by a semantic extension which has been forgotten by the average speaker-writer." --Y.R. Chao, Grammar of Spoken Chinese, page 175.
