xxxx 醲(S) [nóng] strong flavor/fragrance of wine
醲[] ⁶nóng b.f. strong flavor/fragrance of wine 郁 ²nóngyù 醯 xīnóng
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form :) From 酉 (yǒu) 'wine' and 农(農) nóng phonetic.
Undoubtedly the same morpheme as 浓(濃) nóng 'dense', etymologically. 醲郁 is the same word as 濃郁, applied specifically to wine. Also used in 醯醲.
The simplified form  is not in Unicode 6.0. It appears in the ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary (DeFrancis 2003, print edition), in 《现代汉语词典》 and in 《形音義規範字典》.
