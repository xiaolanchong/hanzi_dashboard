==== 醢 [hǎi] preserve; meat sauce
醢 ²hǎi b.f. meat/fish chopped/ground into sauce 醯醢 xīhǎi 菹醢 zūhǎi
From 酉 (yǒu) 'alcohol', 右 and 皿.
Wieger lists a character 右 over 皿, pronounced hǎi, meaning 'a jar' (page 595) (but there's no Unicode character 右 over 皿). Karlgren lists a variant of 醢 hǎi with 𠂉 in place of 𠂇.
