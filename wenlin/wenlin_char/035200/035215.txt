(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 规:) From 夫 (fū) 'man' (originally 矢 shǐ 'arrow'), and 见(見 jiàn) 'see'.
When the 夫 Man is 见 watching, you have to follow the rules. That is not the true explanation of 规, however.
"The seal has, besides 見 (look, control), not 夫 but 矢 arrow, used as a pointed tracing instrument" --Karlgren.
"To have the 見 eye to something, in order to make it straight as an 矢 arrow" --Wieger.
