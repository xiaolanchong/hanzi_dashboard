1815 覆 [fù] (覆盖 fùgài) cover; 顛覆 diānfù subvert; (S复) 反覆 fǎnfù
覆 ¹²fù {E} v. 〈wr.〉 ①cover ②overturn; upset
From 覀 'cover' and 復 fù phonetic.
"To capsize, overthrow, defeat, reverse, on the contrary; reply, repeat; to cover" --Karlgren(1923).
Among full form characters 覆 is in some cases used interchangeably with 復, for example in 答覆 'answer', 反覆 'repeatedly', which can also be written 答復 and 反復.
Among simple form characters 覆 is sometimes, but not always, replaced by 复. Apparently it is replaced 复 in precisely the same cases where 覆 varies with 復:
“复的繁体字。答覆、反覆的覆简化成复, 覆盖、颠覆的覆不简化。” --汉字正字手册。
