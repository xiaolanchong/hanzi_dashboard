==== 觜 [zī] certain stars in Orion   [zuǐ] (=嘴) beak
嘴/觜 zuǐ {A} n. mouth; snout; bill ◆v. talk; speak | Bié duō ∼. 别多∼。 Shut up!
From 此 cǐ phonetic and 角 (jiǎo) 'horn'. It originally meant the beak of a bird, which resembles a horn. By extension, the word zuǐ came to mean 'mouth', which is now written 嘴 zuǐ with 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' added.
Another ancient meaning was the tuft of feathers on the head of an owl or similar bird. It then became the name of a constellation of three stars, said to be the head of a tiger, pronounced zī.
