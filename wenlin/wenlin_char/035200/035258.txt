(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 觉:) The top is (𦥯), the same as 学(學) xué 'learn'. 𦥯 was the old form of 学, before 子 (zǐ) 'child' was added.
The bottom is 见(見 jiàn) 'see'.
The two words 觉 jué and 学 xué are cognates (that is, they are etymologically related, and therefore similar in both sound and meaning).
