---- 詹 [Zhān] (surname); (old form of 谵 zhān 'rant, rave')  [dàn]
詹 ⁷zhān b.f. talkative 詹詹 zhānzhān ◆n. Surname ◆char. 詹尹 zhānyǐn
There are four parts to 詹: ⺈厂八言.
The top 厃 is ⺈(人) person, standing on the brink of a 厂 cliff. This was an old character pronounced zhān; it occurs also in 危 wēi 'danger'. It was used in 詹 as a phonetic, though it also suggests the meaning, since talking too much can be dangerous.
The inside part is 八 or 儿 over 言. Karlgren says it is a 儿 person 言 speaking; Wieger says it is to 八 scatter one's 言 words.
"Talkative; supervise, control, to direct" --Karlgren(1923).
