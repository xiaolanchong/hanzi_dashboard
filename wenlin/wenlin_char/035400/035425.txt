==== 詡(S诩) [xǔ] boast; brag
詡[诩] ³xǔ b.f. boast; brag 自诩 ¹zìxǔ*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 诩:) From 讠(言) and 羽 yǔ phonetic.
"Boast, exaggerate; display, enlarge upon; large, vast; energetic" --Karlgren(1923).
Seemingly cognate or identical with 訏, though Karlgren doesn't mention this.
Sometimes interchanged with 栩 with the meaning 'vivid'.
