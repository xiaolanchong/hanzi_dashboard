xxxx 鑱(S镵) (=􂞞攙䤫) (?鋓) [chán] [chàn]
No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 镵:) From 钅(金 jīn) 'metal' and 毚 chán phonetic.
Note that the simplified form 镵 contains 毚, not  as might be expected. XHC confirms 镵 (钅 plus 毚).
Perhaps related to 铲 chǎn 'shovel'?
