(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 汉:) The left side is 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water'.
The right side  or 又 is short for 暵 hàn ('parched') phonetic. Compare 艰(艱) jiān, 难(難) nán, and 叹(嘆) tàn.
Hàn was the name of a river, then a dynasty (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.), then the most populous Chinese nationality and their language. Sometimes now hàn also means 'man' (as in 老汉, 汉子).
