駐[驻] ³zhù {C} v. ①halt; stay ②be stationed at | ∼ Huá dàshǐ ∼华大使 ambassador to China
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 驻:) From 马(馬 mǎ) 'horse' and 主 zhǔ phonetic.
驻 zhù is etymologically the same word as 住 zhù. 马(馬 mǎ) 'horse' suggests a military emphasis, or the idea of stopping temporarily during a long journey.
