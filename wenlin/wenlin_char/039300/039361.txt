(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 驳:) From 马(馬 mǎ) 'horse' and 爻 (yáo) 'line'.
Both 马 and 爻 are signific. 爻 means lines in the trigrams (☷, ☵, ...) and hexagrams (䷀, ䷝, ...) of the 易经 Book of Changes. A variant form of 驳 has 交 jiāo instead of 爻 yáo, but the meaning is the same: interaction. 驳 bó also has the meaning 'multi-colored'. The primitive meaning is 'piebald', which describes a multi-colored horse: "马 a horse with 爻 or 交 crossed stripes". The trigram ☰ 乾 Heaven is associated with a 驳马, which Wilhelm translates as "wild horse": "a mythical saw-toothed animal, able to tear even a tiger to pieces".
