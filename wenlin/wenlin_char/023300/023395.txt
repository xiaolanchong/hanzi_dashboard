From 禾 (hé) grain and 子 (zǐ) child.
The primitive meaning is 'youngest child', and in modern Chinese 季 jì still has the (rare?) meaning 'fourth or youngest brother', hence the signific 子. 禾 (hé) 'grain' might convey images of planting and harvesting, and the four seasons. However, according to 说文 Shuō Wén, 禾 here is abbreviated from 稚 zhì 'delicate'.
“少称也。从子。从稚省。稚亦声。” -- 说文句读。
稚 zhì was phonetic, or else gave the meaning:
"Infant; 从子, 从稚省, 会意。幼也。The most 稚 (contracted) delicate among the 子 children, the youngest, the last. By extension, the last month of each quarter of the year, that ends the season; hence the derived meaning, season." --Wieger.
(Wieger seems to be quoting a different 说文!)
