---- 孚 [fú] inspire confidence in somebody; 中孚 ䷼ Inner Truth
孚 ²⁰fú 〈wr.〉 v. inspire confidence
From 爫(爪 zhǎo) 'claw' over 子 (zǐ) 'child'.
"To brood; faithful; rely upon, trust -- (a bird) 爪 having between its claws i.e. hatching 子 nestlings" --Karlgren(1923).
"The character fu ('truth') is actually the picture of a bird's foot over a fledgling. It suggests the idea of brooding. An egg is hollow. The light-giving power must work to quicken it from outside, but there must be a germ of life within, if life is to be awakened. Far-reaching speculations can be linked with these ideas." --Wilhelm (易经: 中孚).
