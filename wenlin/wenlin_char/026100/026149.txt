"The spring; gay, wanton -- the small seal has 艸 vegetation reviving under the influence of 日 the sun, 屯 (tún) phonetic; this, however, may be a remaking of the character, and the original upper part may have depicted a tree or bush" --Karlgren.
In fact, the oldest form is just 桑 (sāng) 'mulberry tree' over 日 (rì) 'sun'. The top of the modern character is 𡗗, which happens to be like the tops of 泰 tài, 奏 zòu, 奉 fèng, and 秦 Qín.
