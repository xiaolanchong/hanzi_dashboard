---- 晁 [Cháo] (surname)  [zhāo] [chào]
晁 Cháo n. Surname
From 日 (rì) 'sun' over 兆 zhào phonetic.
The old form 鼂 is 旦 (dàn) 'dawn' over 黽 (mǐn) 'frog'; an earlier form had 皀 (xiāng) 'food' rather than 旦 on top.
Originally the name of a crawling creature. The character 鼂 has also been used similarly to 朝 zhāo 'morning'.
