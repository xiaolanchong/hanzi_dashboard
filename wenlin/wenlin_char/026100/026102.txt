The full form 時 is 日 (rì) 'day' plus 寺 sì ('temple') phonetic. In the simple form 时, 寺 is replaced by 寸 (cùn 'inch': measurement). Time is measured in 日 days.
Historical trivia: before it became 時, it was 旹, the top being 之 zhī phonetic. 之 was replaced by 寺 sì, producing the full form 時. Since 寺 is 之(土) over 寸, the change really consisted in adding 寸 to 旹. For the simple form 时, 之(土) was discarded while 寸 was retained.
