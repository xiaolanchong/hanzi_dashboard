2172 昔 [xī] 昔日 xīrì former times; 往昔 wǎngxī in the past  [cuò]
昔 ¹³xī {E} b.f. former times; the past 昔日 xīrì* 往昔 wǎngxī*
昔 xī originally meant 'dried meat'. The top, now written 龷, is related to 肉 ròu, and represents pieces of meat, which are hung out to dry in the 日 (rì) sun. The meaning became extended:
'Dried meat' --> 'stale' --> 'old' --> 'formerly'.
Now 昔 xī (as in 昔日, 往昔) means the opposite of 今 jīn 'today'.
The original meaning 'dried meat' is written 腊 xī, with 月(肉) ròu 'meat' added. But 腊 xī is now rare, and the character 腊 mostly occurs as the simple form of 臘 là as in 腊肠(臘肠) làcháng 'sausage'.
昔 xī is phonetic in 惜 xī, 错 cuò, 借 jiè, etc.
昔 is simplified from 巤 liè phonetic in 猎(獵) liè, 蜡(蠟) là and 腊(臘) là.
