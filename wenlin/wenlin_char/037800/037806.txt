(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 镇:) From 钅(金 jīn) 'metal' and 真 zhēn phonetic.
"Weigh down, press upon; repress, to subject, regulate, govern; great trading town, mart, market" --Karlgren.
Since the original meaning was to weigh down, and weights are made of metal, 镇 contains 金 as a signific component.
