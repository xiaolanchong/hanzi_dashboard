1926 颳(S刮) [guā] to blow, as the wind  [jǐ]
颳[刮] ²guā {E} v. blow (of wind)
From 風 (fēng) 'wind' and 舌, the same phonetic component as in 话 huà, 活 huó, etc.
At least since the Tang dynasty (618-907), the character 刮 has sometimes been used in place of 颳. Among simple form characters, only 刮 is used.
