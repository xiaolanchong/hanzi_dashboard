---- 熨 [yùn] to iron, press; 熨斗 iron (for ironing)  [yù] [wèi]
熨 ²yùn {E} v. iron; press
'To iron' seems to have been the original meaning of the character 尉, which is now used only as a surname pronounced Wèi or Yù.
For the original meaning 'to iron', 火 (huǒ) 'fire' was added to the bottom of the character.
According to Karlgren, the pronunciation of 熨 was the same as 尉 (modern Wèi or Yù). The pronunciation yùn comes "through confusion with the synonym" 熅 yùn 'to iron'.
