"To kill (by noxious influences); baleful, malign -- etymologically the same word as 殺" --Karlgren(1923).
The character 煞 supposedly originated relatively late as a variant of 殺, but it's hard to see any similarity, and why it contains 刍攵灬 is obscure.
风水 is supposed to reduce the influence of 煞 shà in the home.
