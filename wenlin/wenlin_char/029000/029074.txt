(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 荧:) The full form 熒 is 火火 (huǒ 'fire' doubled) over 冖 (mì 'cover') over 火 another fire:
"Lights, bright -- from three 火 and 冖, the meaning of the latter doubtful" --Karlgren.
In the simple form 荧, the top 火火 is reduced to 艹.
Etymologically 荧 yíng is the same word as 萤 yíng 'glow-worm'.
Contracted to 𫇦, 荧 is phonetic in 营 yíng, 荣 róng, etc.
