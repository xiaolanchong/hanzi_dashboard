1941 姜 [jiāng] ginger
姜/薑/葁 ⁴jiāng {D} n. ①ginger ②Surname
From 𦍌(羊 yáng) 'sheep' and 女 (nǚ) 'woman'.
"The 羊 shepherd 女 clan, of western origin, cf. 羌" --Karlgren(1923).
"The 女 clan (see 姓) of the Emperor 神农 Shénnóng; 羊 is phonetic" --Wieger.
Wieger is mistaken, 羊 had a dental initial, 姜 a guttural initial, so 羊 couldn't be phonetic in 姜. This clan is long extinct. The character for ginger was written 葁, with 艹(草 cǎo) 'plant' over 姜 jiāng phonetic, then 艹 was dropped. Another variant form 薑 is 艹 over 畺 jiāng phonetic.
