From 水 (shuǐ) 'water' turned sideways (it looks just like ☵ Kǎn in the seal character), over 皿 (mǐn) 'dish'.
"It represents a 皿 vase, so full of 水 water, that it overflows. This circumstance is represented by the fact that 水 is over the vase and is bent down, thus expressing its overflowing. By extension, addition, profit, excess, overplus." --Wieger.
