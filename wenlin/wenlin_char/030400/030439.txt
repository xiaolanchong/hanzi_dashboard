1920 盧(S卢) [Lú] (surname); 觚盧 gūlú calabash  [lǘ] [léi]

(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 卢:) The full form 盧 is 虍 over 田 over 皿.
The simple form 卢 is 卜 over 尸; compare 户 hù.
The original meaning of 盧 was 'pot' or 'stove':
"Vessel, pot; fire-pan, stove; black -- 皿 is a tautological addition, for the seal has not 田 field but a picture of a pan, a pot. Does 虍 mean the shape or ornament lines (like the tiger's stripes) or is it phonetic?" --Karlgren.
盧 was borrowed to represent the surname Lú. The word lú meaning 'stove' is written with 火 (huǒ) 'fire' added: 爐(炉).
盧 is a phonetic component in quite a few characters. The simple forms of these characters, for some reason, do not all have 卢. Instead, some have 卢 lú while others have 户 (hù) (one stroke less).
