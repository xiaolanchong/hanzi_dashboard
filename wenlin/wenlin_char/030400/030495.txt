214  真 [zhēn] true; really
真 ¹zhēn* {A} s.v. true; real; genuine | Shì ∼ de ma? 是∼的吗? Is it true? ◆adv. ①really; truly; indeed | Diànyǐng ∼ hǎokàn. 电影∼好看。 The film is really wonderful. ②clearly ◆n. 〈Dao.〉 ①original character of human beings ②newcomer among the immortals
真 would appear to derive from 直 (zhí) 'straight' over 兀 a table. But earlier forms (like 眞) have 匕 at the top, rather than 十. It isn't clear whether there was any relation to 貞(贞) zhēn 'divination; faithful', whose Mandarin pronunciation is the same, and whose meaning is similar.
