1802 盜(S盗) [dào] (盜竊 dàoqiè) steal; 強盜 qiángdào robber
盜[盗] ⁵dào {D} b.f. ①steal; rob; misappropriate 盗卖 dàomài* ②robber; pirate 强盗 qiángdào* 海盗 ¹hǎidào*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 盗:) The bottom is 皿 (mǐn) 'dish'.
The top is 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' plus 欠 qiàn, abbreviated to 次 (cì) in the simple form (a dot has been left out). The combination of 氵 and 欠 qiàn phonetic was an old character for 涎 xián 'saliva'.
"Upper part an ancient form of 涎: the mouth watering for a 皿 dish --- steal food; upper part sometimes wrongly written 次" --Karlgren.
Compare 羡 (or 羨) xiàn as in 羡慕 xiànmù 'envy'.
