xxxx 睘 [huán] (component in 環還寰圜缳鬟 huán)
No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
From 罒(目 mù) 'eye' over 袁 (abbreviated) yuán phonetic.
Karlgren believes 睘 and 環 'ring', 還 'return', 寰 'all around', 圜 'turn around' were all the same word, the signific component being 目 'eye', because an eyeball is round.
In the simple forms 环(環) and 还(還), 睘 has gotten simplified to 不 (bù). Compare the component 褱 huái which also got simplified to 不 as in 怀(懷) huái 'cherish'.
