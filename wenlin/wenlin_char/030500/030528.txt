Originally 着 was just a different way of writing the character 著. Now 著 is mostly written only for the pronunciation zhù, and 着 is written for the other pronunciations; but sometimes 著 is still used rather than 着 among full form characters, regardless of the pronunciation.
着 seems to have more pronunciations and meanings than any other Chinese character. Don't be discouraged. Even Chinese people can't always get it straight, especially the distinction between 着 zháo and 着 zhuó. For example, a friend of mine says 着陆 as zháolù though the dictionaries say zhuólù. The dictionaries disagree on whether 着 in 不着边际 ('not to the point') should be zháo or zhuó. On the other hand, the distinction between 着 zhe and 着 zháo really is important.
