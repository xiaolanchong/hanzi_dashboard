(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 众:) Three 人 (rén) people: a crowd. The ancient form had the three people side by side. To this was added 罒(目 mù) 'eye': all the 众 people in 目 view, producing the full form 眾. The three 人 people are sometimes distorted to 乑, and in the variant 衆, 罒 is changed into 血 (xuè 'blood'). The simple form 众 resembles the original, but with a triangular arrangement. Compare 聚 jù.
