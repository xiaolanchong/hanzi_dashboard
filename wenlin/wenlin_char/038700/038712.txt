From 雨 (yǔ) 'rain', 革 (gé) 'leather', and 月 (yuè) 'moon'.
Originally 霸 meant 'new moon'. The combination of 雨 and 革 was a
character (now obsolete) which meant "to soak leather in rain to make it soft" (--Karlgren); that character was phonetic in 霸. 霸 was borrowed for the word bà 'dominate' because it happened to sound the same.
