From 雨 (yǔ) 'rain' and 路 lù phonetic. 雨 'rain' suggests the meaning 'dew'. Dew collects on things which are exposed outdoors, hence the extended meanings 'outdoors' (露天 lùtiān), 'expose, reveal' (暴露 bàolù). 露 lù also means beverages distilled from flowers or fruits (resembling dew); the extended meaning 'reveal' might also derive from the notion of juices leaking out.
