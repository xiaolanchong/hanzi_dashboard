From 革 (gé) 'leather' and 召 zhào phonetic.
"Hand-drum used by peddlars; it is sounded by twirling it backwards in the hand, so that the two swinging knobs can strike the face of the drum" --Mathews.
Also written 鞉 or 鼗. Strangely enough, we call 鼗 the "simple" form and 鞀 the "full" form, only because 鼗 is in the simple-form GB standard and 鞀 is in the full-form Big5 standard. This is one of those absurd situations where the "simple" form has more strokes than the "full" form!
