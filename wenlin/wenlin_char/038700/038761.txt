"Hide, skin; to flay, take off; deprive of -- picture of a skin split open, a hide seen from the back, with legs apart" --Karlgren.
The extended meaning of 'revolution' may refer to the way a rejected leader has his leadership stripped away like a dead sheep's hide. (革命 originally meant the passing of the mandate of heaven from one ruler to the next, and was later used, first in Japanese and then in Chinese, to translate the western term 'revolution'.)
