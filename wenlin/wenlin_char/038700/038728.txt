(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 灵:) The full form 靈 is 霝 líng over 巫 (wū) 'sorceress'. 霝 is 雨 (yǔ) 'rain' over 口口口 three raindrops. 霝 is a variant form of 零 líng with its original meaning of 'raindrop'; it is phonetic in 靈. At the same time 霝 'raindrop' suggests the meaning of 靈 'spirit', since 巫 sorceresses dance to call on the spirits to make rain.
The simple form 灵, composed of 彐 over 火 (huǒ) 'fire', dates back at least to the Song dynasty. It meant 'slightly warm'; it was borrowed as a substitute for 靈, both characters being pronounced líng.
