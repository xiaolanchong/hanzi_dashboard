632  静(F靜) [jìng] still, quiet; 静电 static electricity
静[靜/竫] ²jìng {B} s.v. still; quiet; calm
Strangely, 青 qīng ('green') and 争(爭) zhèng ('struggle') both seem to be phonetic in 静 jìng. Compare the variant forms 靖 and 竫, both with 立 (lì) 'stand' and either 青 or 爭 as phonetic. 靖 is still used in the word 绥靖 suíjìng 'pacify', whereas 竫 is obsolete.
