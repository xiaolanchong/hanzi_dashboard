2928 澀(S涩) [sè] puckery, astringent; unsmooth
澀[涩] ²sè {E} s.v. ①astringent; puckery | Guǒzi wèidao ∼∼ de. 果子味道∼∼的。 The fruit is astringent. ②rough ③obscure; difficult
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 涩:) From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water', and 刃 (rèn 'blade') over 止 (zhǐ) 'foot'.
In the full form 澀, the right side is doubled.
Originally 歰 was 止 (zhǐ) 'foot' quadrupled, the top two feet pointing downward (no relation with 刃 rèn). Explanation obscure. To this was added 水.
An old variant form 歮 was 止 tripled.
