2333 澱(S淀) [diàn] form sediment; settle; precipitate; 澱粉 starch
澱[淀] ³diàn {E} v. form sediment; precipitate
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 淀:) From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 定 dìng phonetic.
"淀, 浅水也" --玉篇.
Another character, 澱, with 殿 diàn phonetic, has often been treated as interchangeable with 淀. Now among full form characters 澱 is used more with the meaning "sediment", while 淀 is used with the meaning "shallow water". Only 淀 is used among simple form characters.
Both 淀 and 澱 have been used for the word diàn 'indigo', but the more standard way to write it is 靛.
