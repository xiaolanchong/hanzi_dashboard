"A 又 hand holding a 丨 stick, scourge" --Karlgren.
"In the original character for father, a hand can be seen on the right, but scholars disagree on the other part of the character. It is probably an object representing power and authority, perhaps a weapon, perhaps a symbol for ancestors" --Lindqvist.
