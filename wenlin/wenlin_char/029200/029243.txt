---- 爻 [yáo] 易经 line: 阳爻 (as in ☰); 阴爻 (as in ☷)  [xiào]
爻 ⁶yáo b.f. solid and broken lines that form the eight trigrams 爻辞 yáocí
“组成八卦的长短横” --新法编排汉语词典。
Also pronounced xiáo. Symbol of "Mutual action and reaction", says Wieger. Part of 学(學) xué 'learn', 教 jiāo 'teach', 觉(覺) jué 'perceive'.
The 阴爻 yīn yáo, broken lines, and 阳爻 yáng yáo, solid lines, combine to form the 八卦 bā guà:
☰乾 ☷坤 ☳震 ☶艮 ☵坎 ☲离 ☱兑 ☴巽
and the 六十四卦: ䷀乾 ䷁坤 ䷂屯 etc.
From the 易经 Yìjīng Book of Changes we learn that
爻象动乎内。吉凶见乎外。
功业见乎变。圣人之情见乎辞。
"The lines and images move within, and good fortune and misfortune reveal themselves without. The work and the field of action reveal themselves in the changes. The feelings of the holy sages reveal themselves in the judgments." --Wilhelm (translator).
