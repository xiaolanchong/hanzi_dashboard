==== 爿 [qiáng] (component: 'piece of wood')   [pán] strip
爿 ⁵pán n. 〈topo.〉 slit bamboo or chopped wood ◆m. (for shop/field/etc.)
爿 is the left side of 木 mù 'tree', compare 片 piàn.
爿 is often simplified to 丬 (three strokes) as a component.
爿 is used in some modern dialects for a word pán meaning a strip of bamboo or other wood; or a measure word for a strip of land, or a store or a factory.
The reading qiáng is obsolete since 爿 doesn't occur in any words with that pronunciation, but 爿 is phonetic in 戕将状壮妆 etc.
Notice that 爿 qiáng is 片 piàn backwards, and 'q' is 'p' backwards.
爿 is the 90th of the 214 radicals.
