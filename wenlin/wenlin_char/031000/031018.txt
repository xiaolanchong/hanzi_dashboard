==== 礪(S砺) [lì] whetstone; sharpen
礪[砺] ³⁰lì b.f. grindstone; whetstone 砺石 ⁴lìshí 砥砺 dǐlì
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 砺:) From 石 (shí) 'stone' and 厉(厲) lì.
Lì 'whetstone' was originally written 厲, and that may have been the originally meaning of that character. The component 石 was added later.
