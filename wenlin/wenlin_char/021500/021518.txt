后 depicts a woman giving birth. The dripping 㐬 (liú) baby is upside down; in the modern character 后 only its 口 head remains.
后 occurs most often as the simple form of 後 hòu 'after', whose full form 後 is composed of 彳 (chì) 'footstep', 幺 (yāo) 'threads' and 夂 (zhǐ) 'foot'.
The convention of writing 后 instead of 後 is at least as old as the Book of Rites (禮記), one of the Confucian classics.
