吊 ⁴diào {B} v. ①hang ②lift up or let down with a rope/etc. ③mourn ④put in a fur lining ⑤revoke; withdraw ◆m. (for strings of 1,000 cash)
Originally composed of 人 (rén) 'person' and 弓 (gōng) 'bow', an 人 archer with a 弓 bow (not in use) hanging from the shoulder.
A variant form is 弔. The modern form 吊 is thoroughly distorted, so we might remember it better as a 巾 (jīn) napkin hanging down while in suspended between the 口 (kǒu) mouth and the lap or table.
