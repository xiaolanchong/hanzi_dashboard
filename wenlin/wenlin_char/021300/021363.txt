The left side  is from the bottom of 食 (shí) 'eat'; it depicts a pot of food. The right side 卩 is a person facing the food, just about to eat. Hence, 'immediately'. Compare 既 jì 'already', where the person is facing away, having already eaten, and 鄉(乡) xiāng 'countryside' where two folks are eating together.
The right side 卩 jié was re-interpreted as a phonetic component.
