1618 厉(F厲) [lì] 厉害 terrible; formidable  [lài] (name of ancient country)
厉[厲] ⁸lì {E} b.f. ①harsh; severe; serious 严厉 ¹yánlì* ②oppressive; cruel 厉害 lìhai* ③evil ◆n. Surname
From 厂 (chǎng) 'cliff' and 万(萬 wàn) 'ten thousand'.
Karlgren says the original meaning was 'whetstone' (砺), which hardly explains why it is composed of 厂 and 萬. 说文 says 蠆 chài was phonetic (abbreviated), which seems dubious.
Be careful not to confuse 厉(厲) lì with 历(歷) lì 'experience'.
