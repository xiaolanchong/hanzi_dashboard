There are several full forms, the most standard, 歷, being 厂 over 秝 over 止. The only signific part is 止 (zhǐ), representing a foot, for the meaning 'to go through'. A variant 曆 has 日 (rì) 'day' (meaning 'time') in place of 止. The remainder (厂 over 秝) is an obsolete character used in 歷 as a phonetic component.
The simple form 历 is 厂 over 力 lì phonetic.
