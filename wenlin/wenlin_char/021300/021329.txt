Picture of a cup held in the left hand (十 at the bottom is the hand).
"A simple cup held with one hand (the left, anciently the least polite); cf. 尊 zūn 'honoured', a fine cup presented with both hands" --Karlgren.
The pronunciation is the same as 杯 bēi 'cup', but this seems to be a coincidence, since the Cantonese (and Ancient) pronunciations of 卑 and 杯 are slightly different.
