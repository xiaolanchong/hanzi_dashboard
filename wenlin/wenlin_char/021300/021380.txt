---- 厄 [è] (厄难 ènàn) disaster  [ě]
厄/戹 ⁸è {E} 〈wr.〉 b.f. ①strategic place 险厄 ²xiǎn'è ②difficulty; hardship 困厄 kùn'è ◆v. 〈wr.〉 be trapped in a difficult/dangerous situation
Originally 户 (hù) 'door' over 乙 (yì).
"Misfortune, distress. The character represents the slipping in through a narrow door; 隘也。从户, 从乙, 难苦之事也。The modern form completely altered the old one, in which there is neither 厂, nor 㔾" --Wieger.
The resemblence to 危 wēi (危险 'danger') is accidental (or results from a reinterpretation).
