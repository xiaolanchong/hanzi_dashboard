午 wǔ is the seventh of the twelve 地支 Earthly Branches. The Earthly Branches were traditionally used for dividing the day into twelve parts (two hours each). The seventh double-hour is the time between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., so 中午 zhōngwǔ means noon. 午 wǔ also signifies the seventh year, which is the year of the 马(馬) mǎ horse.
