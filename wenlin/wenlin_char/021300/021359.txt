"The incision made when slaughtering an animal" --王宏源.
In the Shang dynasty, 卯 mǎo meant to kill an animal as a sacrifice. That meaning disappeared. The character was later explained as depicting doors.
卯 (sometimes altered to ) is phonetic in 贸 mào, 昴 Mǎo, 留 liú, 柳 liǔ, 聊 liáo, etc. The alternation between m- and l- is unusual; Karlgren(1940) reconstructed the pronunciation of 卯 as *mlog. 劉(刘) Liú originally meant 'kill', and 劉 contains 卯 mǎo as a component; possibly the two words are cognate.
