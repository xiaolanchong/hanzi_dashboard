This character doesn't seem to be explained anywhere (not listed in Wieger, WHY, LLY). It appears to be a combination of 上 and 下.
According to 汉语大字典, the most basic meanings are 'checkpoint' (as in a military roadblock), and 'press tightly between thumb and index finger'. Maybe 卡 is a symbol representing one of these concepts.
