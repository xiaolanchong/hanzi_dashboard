Originally the character 医 was used for a word yì 'quiver':
"匚 case for 矢 arrows" --Karlgren(1923).
The full form of 医 is 醫, which is 殹 over 酉. 殹 is an obsolete character which meant 'the sound of hitting', from 医 yì phonetic and 殳 'hit', signific. 酉 (yǒu) 'wine vessel' was added to form 醫 since doctors use potions.
医 yì 'quiver' is obsolete. 医 is now used as the simple form of 醫 'medical'.
