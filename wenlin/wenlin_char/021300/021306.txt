区[區] ²Ōu n. Surname
The full form 區 is 品 (pǐn) inside 匚. In the simple form 区, 品 is replaced by 㐅.
"To dispose, to stow away 品 things in a 匚 box; 从品在匚中, 会意。By extension, lodging, place, site; 四方也。" --Wieger.
Two words, qū and ōu, were synonymous and both represented by the character 区(區); now the pronunciation ōu survives only as a surname. 区 is phonetic in many characters, some pronounced qū, such as 躯驱岖, and others pronounced ōu, such as 欧鸥殴沤讴瓯.
