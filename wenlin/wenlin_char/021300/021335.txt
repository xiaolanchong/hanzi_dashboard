南 ¹nán* {A} n. ①south ②Surname
南 nā char. 南无 nāmó 南无阿弥陀佛 nāmó Ēmítuófó
Believed by modern scholars to have depicted a hanging percussion instrument, the character was borrowed for the word nán 'south' for unknown reasons. Compare 壳(殼 ké) 'shell', which originally looked like 南 plus a hand striking it with a drumstick.
南 was later re-interpreted as containing 𢆉 rén phonetic.
