695  協(S协) [xié] 協作 xiézuò cooperate
協[协] ⁸xié {E} b.f. ①coordinate; mediate 协调 ¹xiétiáo 妥协 tuǒxié* ②assist 协助 xiézhù*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 协:) Originally written 劦, which is 力 (lì) 'strength' tripled, to mean 'with united forces'. 十 (shí) 'ten' was then added for reinforcement, not to be mistaken for 忄(心 xīn) 'heart'.
In the simple form 协, 劦 is reduced to 办, two of the 力 being replaced by single strokes, so now it looks like 办 bàn 'to do'.
(A variant form of 协 is 勰 xié, from 劦 and 思 sī 'think'.)
