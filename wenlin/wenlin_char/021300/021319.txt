768  升 [shēng] liter; rise, ascend; ䷭ Pushing Upward
升/昇/陞 ³shēng {B} v. ①rise; hoist; ascend ②promote
升 ⁴shēng {E} m. ①liter ②pint (dry measure)
The primary meaning is 'liter', one tenth of a 斗 dǒu. Like 斗, 升 depicted some kind of a measuring cup or ladle.
The character 升 was also borrowed for the word shēng 'rise', which happens to sound the same. (Variant forms for shēng 'rise' are 昇 and 陞.)
