Karlgren says 八 bā is phonetic:
"Assort, assorted, equal, corresponding to; one of a pair, mate; (one of several:) ordinary, common, vulgar; measure of cloth (40 feet long) -- the signific is 匸 box (assort)" --Karlgren(1923).
Wieger's explanation is completely different:
"Half of a whole. The whole is represented by 四. A little more than the half of 四 was kept, so that the character is still recognisable; 分四为二也。一夫也。偶也。That which, being joined with its like, forms a pair, a match. See the compound 甚."
