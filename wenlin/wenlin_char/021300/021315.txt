351  千 [qiān] thousand
千 ¹qiān {A} num. thousand; 1,000 ◆cons. ∼ A wàn B many/entirely AB See qiānxīnwànkǔ
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' plus 一 (yī) 'one'. Possibly 千 qiān was used for counting thousands of 人 people (or 亻 rén was phonetic). 'Two thousand', 'three thousand' etc. were once written like 千 but with additional horizontal strokes.
Notice that 十 shí 百 bǎi 千 qiān and 万 wàn all contain 一 yī.
