From 厂 (chǎng) 'cliff' and 犬 (quǎn) 'dog'. The full form 厭 also contains 日(甘 gān) 'sweet' over 月(肉 ròu) 'meat'. An old form is 猒.
"Satiated; bored with; dislike, loathe -- the original character had only 甘 savory 犬 dog's 肉 meat; a later addition is 厂, the meaning of which is uncertain" --Karlgren.
餍 yàn 'satiated' is etymologically the same word.
