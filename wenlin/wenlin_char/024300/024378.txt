The left side is 弓 gōng 'bow'. The right side 虽 is the modern simple form of 虽(雖) suī 'although'. A 弓 bow is strong, 虽 although it bends.
The true explanation is obscure. An older form was 彊, with 畺 jiāng phonetic.
"The character originally meant 'the larva of the corn-weevil' and was applied, as abbreviation for 彊, to the homophonous word 'strong'..." --Karlgren.
The form 強 (with 厶 rather than 口) is one stroke less, but perversely we call 强 the "simple" form and 強 the "full" form, only because 强 is in the simple-form GB standard and 強 is in the full-form Big5 standard. This is one of those absurd situations where the "simple" form has more strokes than the "full" form.
