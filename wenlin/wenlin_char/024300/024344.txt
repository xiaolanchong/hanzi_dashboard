---- 弘 [hóng] vast; liberal; (弘大) great
宏/弘 ⁵hóng {E} b.f. great; grand; magnificent 宏大 ¹hóngdà* 恢宏 huīhóng
From 弓 (gōng) 'bow, bend' signific and  and 厶 (old form of 肱 gōng) phonetic.
"Vast, magnify; liberal" --Karlgren(1923).
Compare 宏 hóng; hóngdà 'great' is written either 宏大 or 弘大; 宏 and 弘 are interchanged in quite a few words, but it isn't clear whether they are etymologically the same.
