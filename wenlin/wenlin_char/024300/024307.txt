(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 厅:) The full form 廳 (twenty-five strokes) is 广 'building' plus 聽 tīng 'hear'. 厅(廳) tīng 'hall' and 听(聽) tīng 'hear' are cognates.
"The 'hearing' place: court, hall, subprefecture" --Karlgren.
The simple form is 厅 (four strokes). 广 loses its dot to become 厂, and 聽 tīng is replaced by 丁 dīng phonetic.
