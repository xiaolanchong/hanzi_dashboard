(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 贯:) Ancient meaning: a string of cash. The bottom is 贝(貝 bèi) 'money'. The top is a coin with a string through a hole in its middle (like 串 chuàn); that is how ancient Chinese coins were kept. An extended meaning is 'penetrate' (贯穿 guànchuān), like a string going through coins.
"Run a thread through, string together, connect; a string of coins, pearls etc.; penetrate; know thoroughly, intimate; used to" --Karlgren.
惯 guàn as in 习惯 xíguàn 'be used to' is written with 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' added to 贯 guàn.
