(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 贲:) The top 卉 (huì) is three 屮 plants (as in 花卉 huāhuì 'ornamental plants'). The bottom 贝(貝 bèi) is a cowry shell, used as a decoration.
贲 bì and 贲 bēn are apparently two different words that are both written with the same character. 贲 bēn, meaning 'strenuous', is cognate with 奔 bēn 'run fast' (which also contains 卉 huì).
