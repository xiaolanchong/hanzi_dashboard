(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 贴:) From 贝(貝 bèi) 'cowry shell' and 占 zhān phonetic.
It's surprising that 占 zhān is phonetic in 贴 tiē; the ancient pronunciations were approximately *tsiam and *tiep, respectively, according to Karlgren(1923).
Compare 帖, with which 贴(貼) is often interchanged. According to modern standards, 贴(貼) is only pronounced in the first tone.
