From 王(玉 yù) 'jade' and 夬 guài 'break-through'. 夬 itself may have originally depicted a hand and a jué ring. According to Karlgren, it was an archer's thumbring, and the meaning 'break-through' is extended from "the bursting loose of the bow string". 汉语大字典 confirms that 玦 also meant an archer's thumbring.
