1657 灑(S洒) [sǎ] sprinkle  [xiǎn] 灑然  [xǐ] [lí] [shī]
灑[洒] ¹sǎ {B} v. ①sprinkle; spray ②spill; shed | Tāng ∼ le. 汤∼了。 The soup spilled. ◆b.f. unrestrained 潇洒 xiāosǎ*
洒[灑] ¹²xiǎn b.f. ①alarm; surprise 洒然 ²xiǎnrán ②cold
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 洒:) From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 西 xī phonetic. In the full form 灑, the phonetic part is 麗 lì (yes, it really is phonetic).
The forms 洒 and 灑 are both ancient, and appear to have always been interchangeable, both for sǎ as in 潇洒(瀟灑) xiāosǎ, and for xiǎn as in 洒然(灑然) xiǎnrán, except that 洒如 xiǎnrú was always (?) written with 洒.
Don't confuse 洒 with 酒 jiǔ 'wine'.
Compare 撒 sǎ 'scatter, sprinkle'.
