From 疋 shù and 㐬 (liú) 'newborn with hair'.
Nothing is sparser than a newborn baby's hair.  is just 子 'baby' upside-down. 㐬 shows the hair coming out of the head, which is at the bottom. The left side is from 疋 shù, phonetic, 疋 being modified to 乛 over .
疏 shū is phonetic in 蔬 shū (蔬菜 shūcài vegetables).
A variant form of 疏 is 疎, with 束 in place of 㐬.
