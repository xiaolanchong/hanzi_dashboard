"The seal has 匕(人) and 矢 to the left, and 子 and 止 to the right; interpretation uncertain" --Karlgren(1923).
The right side mutated slightly, from 子 (zǐ) 'child' over 止 (zhǐ) 'stop', to 龴 over 疋. 矢 (shǐ) is an arrow. 匕 is 人 (rén) a person's body, sideways. Apparently we have a 矢 weapon, and a 匕 victim (who's been 止 stopped dead). Can there be any 疑 doubt that the 子 child is our only suspect?
