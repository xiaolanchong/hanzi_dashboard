(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 画:) "Draw boundary lines...delineate, draw, paint; drawing, painting; stroke (in writing) -- 聿 to draw 凵 or 一 lines: boundaries of a 田 field" --Karlgren.
An old form is 畵. In the common full form 畫, the bottom 凵 is reduced to 一.
In the simple form 画 the top 聿 is left out.
Compare 昼(晝) zhòu which is similiar to 画(畫) in the full form.
