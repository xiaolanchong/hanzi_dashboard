疆 ⁷jiāng {E} b.f. border 边疆 biānjiāng
The ancient form was 畺.
"田 fields with 三 boundary lines" --Karlgren.
弓 (gōng) 'bow' and 土 (tǔ) 'earth' were added later, since 畺 was considered insufficiently complex. The natural course of action was to take the character 彊, which is the old form of 强 qiáng 'strong', and add to it 土 (tǔ) 'earth' which is nearly invisible in the lower left corner.
