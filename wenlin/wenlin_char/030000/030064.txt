(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 异:) The full form 異 is 田 over 共. It depicted a person wearing a scary mask (the head is like that of 鬼 guǐ 'demon'), waving hands in the air. Strange; different.
The simple form 异 is 巳(已) yǐ phonetic over 廾 'two hands'. It is over two thousand years old (说文).
異 is a component in 戴翼冀瀵 (in these characters 異 is not simplified to 异).
