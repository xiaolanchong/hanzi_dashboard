2112 畝(S亩) [mǔ] acre  [mǒu]
畝[亩] ²mǔ {B} m. (of area equal to 0.0667 hectare; 1/6 acre)
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 亩:) 田 tián 'field' suggest the meaning 'acre'. The full form 畝 has 亠 and 久 added to 田, the interpretation of 亠 and 久 being uncertain.
In the simple form 亩, the component 久 is left out.
A variant form is 畆.
