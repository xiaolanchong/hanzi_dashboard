擊[击] ³jī {D} b.f. ①strike; hit; beat; knock 打击 dǎjī* ②attack; assault 攻击 ¹gōngjī* ③bump into 撞击 zhuàngjī*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 击:) Originally 毄, from 軎 and 殳 (shū) 'beat'. The meaning was, to jostle or bump, 口 representing the end of a 車 (chē) war chariot's axle. 毄 became 𣪠 by the omission of one stroke. Then a 手 (shǒu) hand was added, forming 擊. The modern simple form is 击.
