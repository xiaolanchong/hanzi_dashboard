权[權] ²quán {D} n. ①〈wr.〉 steelyard weight ②right; power; authority ③Surname ◆adv. tentatively; for the time being ◆b.f. weigh; assess 权衡 ¹quánhéng
From 木 (mù) 'wood' and 雚 guàn phonetic.
雚 is abbreviated to 又 yòu in the simple form 权.
The primary meaning is 'to weigh or balance', as in the phrase 权其轻重 'weigh up the matter carefully'. Possibly ancient scales were made of 木 wood, rather than metal.
