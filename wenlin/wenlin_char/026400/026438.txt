1819 杆 [gān] pole  [gǎn] (F桿) shaft  [gàn]
杆[桿] ⁴gǎn {E} m. (for shafted implements) | Wọ̌ yǒu yī̠ ∼ qiāng. 我有一∼枪。 I have a gun. ◆n. shaft; rod M:ge/²gēn 个/根
杆 ⁴gān {B} b.f. pole; staff 杆子 ²gānzi
From 木 (mù) 'wood' and 干 gān.
Etymologically the same as 竿 gān, and 干 gān in its original meaning, a tree trunk used as a battering ram. 竿, with 竹 (zhú) 'bamboo', is used more for smaller poles, especially those made of bamboo, while 杆 is used for larger poles or those made of wood.
杆 is pronounced gǎn, third tone, as a measure word; with this pronunciation, among full form characters, the form 桿 is sometimes used instead of 杆.
