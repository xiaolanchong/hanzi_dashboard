芸[蕓] ⁹yún char. 芸薹 ²yúntái
From 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' and 云 yún (or 雲 yún) phonetic.
The two characters 芸 and 蕓 were originally unrelated. 芸 is the original character for 'rue' (a medicinal herb, Ruta graveolens). Essence of rue is burnt on festive occasions. 蕓 occurs only in the word 蕓薹 yúntái 'rape' (a different herb, Brassica napus). Rapeseed oil is used as a lubricant.
芸 is now used as the simplified form of 蕓 in addition to its original usages.
芸 (not 蕓!) also refers to books and libraries, because rue was used to keep insects from the books.
In 芸芸 'numerous', 芸 is a variant of 纭.
