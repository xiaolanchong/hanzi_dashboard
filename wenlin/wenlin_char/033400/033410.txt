The full form 節 is 竹 (zhú) 'bamboo' over 即 jí phonetic.
The simple form 节 is 艹(草 cǎo) 'plant' over 卩 jié phonetic (written  rather than 卩).
The basic meaning is 'bamboo joint'. Hence, division, section; season; festival, holiday. The extended meanings 'economize' and 'moral integrity' may stem from the idea of proper behaviour according to the time of year; these meanings may also be related to 卩 jié which depicts a person kneeling in subservience.
