==== 秫 [shú] (秫秸 shújiē) sorghum ( = 高粱 gāoliang)
秫 ⁵shú b.f. gaoliang; sorghum 秫秸 shújiē 秫秕 shúbǐ
From 禾 (hé) 'grain' and 术 shù. This was the original meaning of 术, which is a picture of the plant. The 禾 was added later. 术 was phonetic in 術 shù 'art, skill', which was then simplified to 术, which could be done since the original character 术 had been replaced by 秫.
