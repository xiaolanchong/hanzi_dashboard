From 𤔔, simplified to 舌 (shé 'tongue'), and 辛 (xīn) 'suffering'.
𤔔 was the old form of 乱(亂) luàn 'unravel, confusion'.
'To 亂 unravel a 辛 crime' --Karlgren.
'To 亂 rid oneself of an 辛 accusation, to clear one's self, to excuse one's self... 犹埋辜也。' --Wieger.
When saying goodbye, it is humble, and therefore polite, to apologize for being such a nuisance, and to make lots of excuses for everything. Hence the extended meaning of flowery language.
The component 舌 shé 'tongue' might be re-interpreted as indicating the meaning 'words'. In fact, 辞 cí is etymologically the same word as 词 cí 'word' (according to Karlgren), and 词典 cídiǎn 'dictionary' can also be written 辞典.
