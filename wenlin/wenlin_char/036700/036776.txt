1982 辨 [biàn] distinguish, differentiate  [biǎn] [bàn] [piàn]
辨 ⁵biàn {E} v. differentiate; distinguish; discriminate
From 辡 biàn and 刂(刀 dāo) 'knife'.
Etymologically the same word as 辩 biàn 'argue'. Two 辛 criminals and a 刀 knife. The 刀 knife is probably not to be interpreted as a weapon used by the 辛 criminals; it indicates the meaning of seperation, as in 分 fēn. The obsolete character 釆 biàn once represented the same word.
