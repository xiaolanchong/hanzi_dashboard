(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 农:) "The husbandman; 耕人也。A 囟 head, two  hands, and 晨 the break of day contracted, 日 giving place to 囟. The man who works from early dawn; all field-work being done very early in hot countries 耕作必于晨" --Wieger.
Don't confuse the simple form 农 with 衣 yī 'clothing'.
