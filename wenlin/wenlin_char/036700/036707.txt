xxxx 轣(S𫐆) [lì] 轣轆 lìlù pulley for drawing water; rails for vehicles
轣[𫐆] ⁴²lì char. 𫐆辘 ³lìlù
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 𫐆:) From 车(車) 'car' and 历(歷) lì phonetic.
Compare 轹(轢). 轣 has sometimes been used as a variant of 轢, but lìlù does not seem to be written with 轹(轢).
The simplified form is in 辞海, but not in HDZ. It was added to Unicode 5.2.
辞海 says lìlù is also written 历鹿.
