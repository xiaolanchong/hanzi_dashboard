1348 辯(S辩) [biàn] (辯論 biànlùn) debate, argue; 辯證 diagnosis  [pián] [biǎn] [bàn]
辯[辩] ⁶biàn {E} v. argue; dispute; debate
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 辩:) Originally 辡, from 辛 (xīn) doubled.
"Two 辛 criminals against each other" --Karlgren(1923).
讠(言) yán 'words' was added later. 辩 is etymologically the same word as 辨 biàn 'discriminate', which has 刂(刀 dāo) 'knife' instead of 言.
Compare 狱 yù.
