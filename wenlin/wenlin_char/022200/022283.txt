(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 国:) The old character 或 depicted 口 territory defended by 一 a wall and 戈 weapons. Then 或 got surrounded by 囗, representing the borders of a nation, producing the full form 國. (或 was then borrowed for the similar sounding word huò 'or'.) The simple form 国 dates back to the Sòng dynasty (960-1279); it has 玉 (yù) 'jade' in place of 或. There was a variant 囯 with 王 (wáng) 'king' in the middle.
