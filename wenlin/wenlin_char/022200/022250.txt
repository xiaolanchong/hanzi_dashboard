---- 囪(S囱) [cōng] 煙囪 yāncōng chimney
囪[囱] ⁴cōng {E} b.f. chimney 烟囱 yāncōng
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 囱:) Picture of a window, skylight, or vent. Occurs in only one common word, 烟 囱 yāncōng 'chimney'. 囱 is a component in 窗 chuāng 'window'; etymologically, 囱 cōng and 窗 chuāng were originally the same word.
The full form of 匆(悤) cōng (as in 悤忙 cōngmáng 'in a hurry') is 囱 over 心. Also notice the full form of 总(總) zǒng.
