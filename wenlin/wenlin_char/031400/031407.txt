窯[窑] ²yáo {C} n. ①kiln ②(coal) pit ◆b.f. ①cave dwelling 窑洞 ²yáodòng ②brothel 窑子 yáozi
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 窑:) From 穴 (xué) 'hole' and (full form:) 羔 gāo phonetic or (simple form:) 缶 (fǒu) 'jar'.
A variant form is 窰, with 䍃 yáo ('jar') phonetic. (窯 seems to be the oldest, listed in 说文解字. 窰, listed in 广韵, is probably older than 窑, listed in 正字通).
