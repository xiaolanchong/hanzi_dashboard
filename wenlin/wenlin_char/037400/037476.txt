(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 钩:) From 钅(金 jīn) 'metal' and 勾 gōu 'hook' or 句 jù ('sentence').
Originally 句 was the character for 'hook', 勹 depicting a hook and 口 kǒu being phonetic. 句 sometimes became 勾 (the variation between 口 and 厶 is common). As 句 and 勾 took on extended meanings, 金 'metal' was added for the literal meaning 'hook'.
The full form is 鉤, the simple form is 钩, and a variant form is 鈎.
