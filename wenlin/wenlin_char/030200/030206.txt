==== 痾(S疴) [kē] illness    [ē]
痾[疴] ¹³kē b.f. illness 沉疴 chénkē
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 疴:) From 疒 (nì) 'sick' and 可 kě or 阿 ē phonetic.
The simple form 疴, which is listed in 說文解字, seems to be older than the full form 痾, which is listed in 廣韻 and 集韻.
The old pronunciation ē is no longer current.
