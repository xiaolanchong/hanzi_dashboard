---- 摺 [zhé] fold  [lā] [xié]
摺 ⁶zhé b.f. ①fold 打摺 ²dǎzhé ②folder; record book 白摺子 báizhézi
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 習 xí phonetic.
Sometimes regarded as a full form for 折 zhé fold, but it is in fact a completely unrelated word and character. But 摺 and 折 both mean 'fold', and in Mandarin they have, by coincidence, come to be pronounced the same (Mandarin has lost nearly all final consonants; in those dialects that preserve the final consonants -t and -p, 摺 and 折 are distinguished in pronunciation).
“十四笔。‘折’的繁体字。在‘折’和‘摺’意义可能混淆 时, ‘摺’仍用揩。” --汉字正字手册。
(摺 simply means fold; 折 has various other meanings; the 汉字正字手册 seems to be recommending that 摺 be retained when necessary to indicate that 'fold' is meant rather than some other meaning.)
