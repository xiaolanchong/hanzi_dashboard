1575 撤 [chè] remove; withdraw
撤 ¹chè {C} v. ①remove; take away | Bǎ jiǔcài ∼ xiàqu. 把酒菜∼下去。 Take away the wine and dishes. ②withdraw; evacuate
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand', 育 (yù) 'nourish', and 攵(攴 pū) 'beat'.
The right side  might have been a phonetic component.
"The sound and sense of the phonetic...is unknown" --Karlgren.
The full form of 彻(徹) chè, as well as 澈 chè and 辙 zhé, contain the same component . 汉语大字典 shows ancient forms of 徹 in which the middle is 鬲 (lì) 'cooking tripod' rather than 育. It also shows oracle bone and bronze characters composed of 鬲 plus 又 (yòu) 'hand'. Possibly the meaning was 'to eat up completely' which could have led to both the modern words 徹 chè 'thorough' and 撤 chè 'remove'.
Don't confuse 撤 chè with 撒 sā, which has 龷 rather than .
