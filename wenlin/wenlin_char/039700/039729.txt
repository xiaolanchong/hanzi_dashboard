1869 鬱(S郁) [yù] dense; 憂鬱 yōuyù sad, depressed, melancholy
鬱[郁] ¹⁷yù {E} b.f. ①lush; verdant 葱郁 cōngyù ②gloomy; depressed 忧郁 ¹yōuyù 郁闷 yùmèn*
鬱 is composed of 缶 (fǒu) 'jar' between two 木 (mù) trees, over 冖 (mì) 'cover', 鬯 (chàng) 'sacrificial wine', and 彡 (shān).
"Dense, pent-up, anxious, grieved -- there was a homophonous character with a picture of two hands instead of 林, meaning 'aromatic herbs' (hands laying 鬯 aromatic herbs in 缶 a pot); this is abbreviated phonetic and 林 signific in 'dense'" --Karlgren.
Wieger describes the homophonous character as follows:
"The offering of a 缶 vessel full of 鬯 fragrant wine; 彡 represents the decorations of this vessel; 冖 is probably used to keep apart the numerous elements of this compound."
The simple form is 郁 (which is another old character, not a modern invention).
