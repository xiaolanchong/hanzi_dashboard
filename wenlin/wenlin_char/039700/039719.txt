(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 闹:) The full form 鬧 is 鬥 (dòu) 'fight' plus 市 (shì) 'market'.
"鬥 fight in 市 the market" --Karlgren.
The abbreviation to 閙, with 門 (mén) 'door' instead of 鬥, has existed since the Song dynasty. The simple form is 闹. As noisy as having a 市 market place just outside your 门 door.
