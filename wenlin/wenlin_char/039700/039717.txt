The left 丨 vertical stroke is written first, before the left 王, according to these authorities: (1) Lindqvist; (2) Halpern; (3) McNaughton; (4) 简化字总表捡字:从繁体查简体. However, some authorities disagree, namely: (1) Rita Choy; (2) Hanyu Da Zidian; (3) Y.R. Chao.
Wenlin versions 1 and 2 had 王 first; for Wenlin 3.0 it was changed to 丨 first. This is more consistent with 門.
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 斗:) "A measure of 十 ten 勺 ladles or 升 pints; a peck; 十升也。勺也。有柄。The ancient forms represent a 勺 ladle and 十 ten. The modern forms are mutilated" --Wieger.
The pronunciation dòu with the meaning 'fight' has a different origin. Its full form is written 鬥.
鬥 depicts a pair of wrestlers in hand-to-hand struggle. 斗 is sometimes added to 鬥 as a phonetic, forming 鬦. Other variants are 鬭 and 鬪.
Among simple form characters, 斗 is used for both 斗 dǒu and 鬥(鬦鬭鬪) dòu.
