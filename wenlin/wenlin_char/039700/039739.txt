==== 鬻 [yù] (书) sell, vend  [zhōu] [jū]
鬻 ³⁵yù b.f. sell, esp. improperly or in straitened circumstances 鬻文 ²yùwén 鬻狱 ⁶yùyù 鬻子 yùzǐ 卖妻鬻女 màiqīyùnǚ ◆char. 獯鬻 Xūnyù
From 粥 'porridge' and 鬲 'caldron'.
At one time 鬻 was simply a variant of 粥 zhōu 'gruel'. It was a more complete picture, with the 鬲 caldron under the boiling 米 rice with 弓 steam coming off.
The pronunciations yù and zhōu have drifted from nearly identical ancient sounds (something like diuk and tiuk according to Karlgren). The secondary meaning took the path:
Gruel --> nourish --> sell food --> sell.
Karlgren says 鬻 yù is etymologically the same word as 育 yù.
