鬯 is the 192nd of the 214 radicals. It's the radical of 鬱 yù, and some very obscure (Unicode Extension B) characters.
In the standard stroke order, 乂 is written first, then the four dots, then 凵, finally 匕. (According to 现代汉语通用字笔顺规范, 1997. In versions of Wenlin up to and including 3.0, a different stroke order was given, with 凵 first, then 乂, then the four dots, finally 匕, in agreement with 鬱 in Rita Mei-Wah Choy's book "Read And Write Chinese", 1990, China West Books.)
