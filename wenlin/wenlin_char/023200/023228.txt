==== 媼(S媪) [ǎo] (書) old woman
媼[媪] ³ǎo n. 〈wr.〉 old woman
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 媪:) From 女 (nǚ) 'woman' and 昷(𥁕) wēn (phonetic).
There was a word written 媪 and pronounced like 昷 wēn, meaning "old
woman"; later the character 媪 was used for this synonymous word with a
completely unrelated pronounciation (now ǎo).
