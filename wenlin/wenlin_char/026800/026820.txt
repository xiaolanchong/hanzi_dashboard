1244 棄(S弃) [qì] (放棄 fàngqì, 抛棄 pāoqì) abandon, give up
棄[弃] ⁵qì {E} b.f. ①discard; abandon 抛弃 pāoqì* ②give up 放弃 ¹fàngqì* 弃权 qìquán
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 弃:) The top  is 子 (zǐ) 'baby' upside down. The bottom 廾 derives from  two hands pushing away the baby, abandoning it.
In some old forms the baby seems to be in a basket (其 qí). That basket (or a shovel for throwing away the baby) may survive in the full form 棄.
