1753 鑒(S鉴) [jiàn] 鑒定 jiàndìng appraise; 借鑒 jièjiàn draw lessons from
鑒[鉴] ¹⁵jiàn {E} v. ①reflect; mirror ②inspect; examine ③take as a lesson ④〈court.〉 peruse (a letter) ◆n. ①ancient bronze mirror ②warning; object lesson
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 鉴:) From (監) jiān phonetic over 金 (jīn) 'metal'.
The primary meaning of 鉴 jiàn is 'ancient bronze mirror'. It is cognate with 监 jiān (as in 监督 jiāndū), meaning 'inspect' (a mirror is used for inspecting).
Notice how 監 is altered in the full form 鑒: 皿 becomes 罒 and moves to the right under , to make room for 金.
