(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 钟:) The simple form 钟 is from 钅(金 jīn) 'metal' and 中 zhōng phonetic. It corresponds to two different full form characters: 鐘, with 童 tóng phonetic, and 鍾, with 重 zhòng phonetic.
"鐘 bell, clock" --Karlgren(1923).
"鍾 cup; an ancient measure; capacity, endowments" --Karlgren(1923). "鍾 an ancient measure equal to 4 斗. A cup, a goblet... To bring together. To cherish, to love." --Mathews. Compare 盅.
Versions 1 and 2 of the Wenlin dictionary always used 鐘 as the full form of 钟, but this was incorrect. For example, 钟爱 is written 鍾愛 (not *鐘愛) among full form characters.
A non-standard simplified variant of 鍾 is 锺.
