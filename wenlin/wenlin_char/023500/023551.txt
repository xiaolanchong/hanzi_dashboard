The top was 毛 (máo) 'hair' over 人 (rén) 'person', like the top of 老 (lǎo) 'old'. The wavy lines in the middle are supposed to be an old form of 畴 chóu 'farmland':
"To trace the furrows in the fields; 耕治之田也。耕屈之形。" --Wieger.
That old form of 畴 chóu was used in 寿 shòu as a phonetic. At the bottom was 口 kǒu 'mouth'. 寸 cùn 'hand' was later added to the full form 壽. The significance of 口 and 寸 in 壽 is not certain. The simple form 寿 is 丰 over 寸, the vertical line of 丰 curving down to the left of 寸.
