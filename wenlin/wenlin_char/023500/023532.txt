1043 寬(S宽) [kuān] wide, broad; extend; relax
寬[宽] ¹kuān* {B} s.v. ①wide; broad ②generous; lenient ③comfortably off; well-off ◆n. width; breadth ◆v. ①relax; relieve ②extend
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 宽:) The top is 宀 (mián) 'roof'; ideally a roof should be wide. The lower part was a picture of a goat, an obsolete character meaning 'goat' and pronounced similarly to kuān, used as a phonetic. It differed from 莧 by having an extra dot. But in the simple form, the extra dot is omitted and 宽 consists of 宀 and 苋, or 宀, 艹 and 见.
