517  尔(F爾) [ěr] (archaic:) you; 尔后 thereafter; 高尔夫 golf
尔[爾] ²ěr {E} pr. 〈wr.〉 ①you ②this; that; thus ◆suf. -ly
Which came first, 尔 or 爾?
Wieger cites this explanation for 尔:
“从入丨八, 会意。八者气之分也。”
Then 爾 came from 尔 (phonetic), 巾 ( = 两 a balance) and 爻爻 weights on both sides, to give the meaning "symmetry, harmony of proportions".
Karlgren(1923) says of the form 爾, "...original sense and hence explanation of character uncertain", and considers 尔 an abbreviation.
The pronunciation was once something like nzie. This produced both ěr and nǐ, the latter written 你 nǐ, which is the modern word for 'you'. Now 尔 is only used in a few adverbs and archaic expressions, and in foreign loan words.
