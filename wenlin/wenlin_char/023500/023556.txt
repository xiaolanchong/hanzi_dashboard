The modern character 射 is 身 (shēn) 'body' plus 寸 (cùn) 'hand'. An older seal form was 身 body plus 矢 (shǐ) 'arrow'. The oldest oracle-bone and bronze characters clearly depict a bow and arrow, and sometimes a hand.
"At the standardization of characters in the third century B.C., the bow was unfortunately exchanged for the character for BODY, which in its oldest form bears some similarity to BOW" --Lindqvist.
射 shè is phonetic in 谢(謝) xiè 'thank'.
