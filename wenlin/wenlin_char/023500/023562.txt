A 寸 hand holding 酋 (yǒu) a wine cup, as an offering to ancestors, in worship. 寸 cùn may also be phonetic (originally there were two hands, which were changed to 寸 cùn "probably for phonetic reasons" --Karlgren).
尊 zūn is phonetic in 遵 zūn 'obey', and in 蹲 dūn 'squat'. 尊 zūn 'respect' also suggests the meaning of 遵 zūn 'obey' but it might be far-fetched to suppose that 尊 zūn 'respect' suggests the meaning of 蹲 dūn 'squat'.
