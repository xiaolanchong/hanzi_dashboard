"The seal has a 宀 roof, 艹(艸) doubled, in the middle 人 a man and below 冫 ice --- the whole now badly deformed: a 人 man laying up 艸 fuel in 宀 the house against 冫 the cold" --Karlgren.
It is also possible that the 艹 grass was used to fill cracks in the walls, to conserve heat.
Compare 赛 sài and 塞 sāi, which (by coincidence) are the same on top as 寒 hán.
