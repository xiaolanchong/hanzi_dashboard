(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 宁:) An old form 寍 was composed of 宀 (mián) 'roof', 心 (xīn) 'heart' and 皿 (mǐn) 'dish'. 丁 (dīng) was added to the bottom to produce the full form 寧.
"Peace, rest; tranquilize; (find peace in, like:) to prefer... a 宀 house, a 心 heart and 皿 a cup... the addition below is not 丁 in the seal but 丂 (qiǎo) take breath, rest" --Karlgren.
The simple form 宁 is 宀 (mián) 'roof' over 丁 dīng.
