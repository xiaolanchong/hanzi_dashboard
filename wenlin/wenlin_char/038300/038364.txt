(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 关:) The full form 關 has 門 (mén) 'door' to indicate the meaning and numerous strokes inside (threads being woven -- once a phonetic component).
关 appears as a part of 联 lián and 送 sòng, although none of the characters containing 关 has any historical relationship with 关(關) guān.
Compare 关系 guānxi with 联系 liánxì.
