---- 閨(S闺) [guī] small door; 閨女 guīnü girl; daughter
閨[闺] ⁵guī {E} b.f. ①boudoir; women's quarters 深闺 shēnguī ②〈wr.〉 small door 闺门 guīmén*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 闺:) From 门(門 mén) 'door' and 圭 guī phonetic.
闺 guī used to mean a woman's apartment, hence the association between 'small door' and (闺女 guīnü) 'girl, daughter'.
