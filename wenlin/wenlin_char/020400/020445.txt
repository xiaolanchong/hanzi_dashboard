From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 呆. 呆 was originally 子 (zǐ) 'child'; two strokes 八 were added to the sides, maybe representing swaddling clothes.
"On the oracle bones and bronzes, in some cases we see the child safe in the adult's arms, and other times the child is carried on a back, just as children are carried in China today" --Lindqvist.
The character 呆 (without 亻) has been borrowed as an abbreviation of a completely unrelated character 獃, modern 呆 dāi 'stupid; stay'.
Etymologically 保 bǎo 'protect' is the same word as 堡 bǎo 'fortress' and 褓 as in 襁褓 qiǎngbǎo 'swaddling clothes'.
