1436 侵 [qīn] (侵略 qīnlüè, 侵入) invade  [qǐn]
侵 ²qīn {E} b.f. ①invade; intrude into 入侵 rùqīn* ②approach; get near to 侵晨 qīnchén
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 𠬶, which is a 又 (yòu) hand holding a 帚 (zhǒu) broom. The ancient meaning was 'gradually approach'; somehow this meaning was associated with the idea of sweeping. The meaning 'invade' is an extension of 'approach'.
