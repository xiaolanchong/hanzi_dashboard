==== 佇(S伫) [zhù] 躊佇 chóuzhù hesitate (to make a move)
佇[伫] ¹³zhù {E} b.f. stand for a long while 伫立 ¹zhùlì 延伫 ¹yánzhù
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 伫:) Originally a picture of a room, which came to be written 宁:
"Attendant's room or space in the palace, space between exterior gate and 屏 screen" --Karlgren.
An extended meaning of the same word was written 佇, with the addition of 亻(人 rén) 'person':
"(Attend:) stand and wait; to long for" --Karlgren.
Among simple form characters, the shape 宁 is used as an abbreviation of 寧 níng, so a new shape 宀 over 一 was invented as an abbreviation of the earlier 宁. That's why the simple form of 佇 is 伫.
