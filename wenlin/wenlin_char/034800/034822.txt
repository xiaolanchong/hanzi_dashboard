==== 蠆(S虿) [chài] ancient name for kind of scorpion; 水蠆 shuǐchài nymph
蠆[虿] chài b.f. 〈wr.〉 scorpion 虿尾 chàiwěi 蜂虿 fēngchài
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 虿:) From 万(萬 wàn) 'scorpion' over 虫 (chóng) 'insect'.
萬 originally depicted a scorpion, then was borrowed for the word wàn 'ten thousand'. Here it has its original meaning.
