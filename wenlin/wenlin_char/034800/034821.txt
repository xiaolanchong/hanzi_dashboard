---- 蠅(S蝇) [yíng] [ying] 蒼蠅 cāngying fly
蠅[蝇] ³yíng {E} b.f. fly 苍蝇 cāngying*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 蝇:) From 虫 (chóng) 'insect' and 黾(黽) měng 'toad'.
Karlgren(1923) says it's "phonetically very curious" that 黾 měng is phonetic in both 蝇 yíng 'fly' and 绳 shéng 'rope'. Maybe 蝇 contains 黾 because toads eat flies.
