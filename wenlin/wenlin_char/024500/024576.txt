怀[懷] ¹huái {C} n. ①bosom ②mind; heart; state of mind ③Surname ◆v. ①think of; miss ②cherish ③conceive (a child)
From 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' and 褱, which is simplified to 不 (bù). The original character was 褱 (without 忄):
"Wieger aptly explains the middle part as eye-lashes let down over 罒 the eye: to hide; hide in 衣 the robe" --Karlgren.
Note that 衣 (yī) 'clothing' is split into two parts, 亠 above and the rest below. 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' was added to emphasize the meaning: carry in the bosom, cherish. 褱 has been simplified to 不; compare 坏(壞) huài 'bad'.
