1286 徹(S彻) [chè] 徹底 thorough; 貫徹 carry out, implement
徹[彻] ²chè {E} b.f. thorough; penetrating 彻底 chèdǐ*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 彻:) The simple form 彻 is composed of 彳 (chì) 'walk' and 切 qiè phonetic.
The full form 徹 has obscure origins; the middle is 育 (yù) 'nourish' and the right side is 攵(攴 pū) 'beat'. Compare 撤 chè 'remove'.
