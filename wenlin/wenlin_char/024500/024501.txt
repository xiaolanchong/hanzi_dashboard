From 微 (wēi) 'small' and 壬 tǐng phonetic.
徵 is the full form of 征 zhēng in some of its meanings; the two old characters 征 and 徵 are now both written 征 when pronounced zhēng among simple form characters.
Compare 微 wēi 'tiny', and 徽 huī (安徽 Ānhuī).
I don't know how the reading zhǐ and the meaning as a musical note fit historically.
