This character is used in the 道德经 to mean 'manifestation', or 'outcome', the result of looking at the world in detail, so that the 万物 are all seen distinctly. It is contrasted with 妙 miào 'subtlety', or 'mystery', which is the same thing (i.e. everything) experienced in such a way that it all blends together.
