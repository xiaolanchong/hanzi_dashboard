==== 鰥(S鳏) [guān] wifeless, widowed  [guàn] [kūn] [gǔn]
鰥[鳏] ⁷guān {E} b.f. widower 鳏夫 guānfū
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 鳏:) The left side is 鱼(魚 yú) 'fish'.
"A kind of pike (fish which lives solitary); solitary, alone; widower" --Kargren.
The right side was a picture of the fish, Karlgren says, and has nothing to do with 眾 zhòng.
