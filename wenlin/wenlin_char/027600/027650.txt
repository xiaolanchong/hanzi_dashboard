==== 氂(S牦) [máo] 氂牛 máoniú yak  [lí]
氂[牦] ⁶máo {E} char. 牦牛 máoniú 牦针 máozhēn
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 牦:) From 牛 (niú) 'ox' or 𠩺 and 毛 máo phonetic.
Formerly also pronounced lí. There seems to be some confusion involved. The old word for yak was 犛 lí, from 𠩺 lí phonetic and 牛 ox, signific. Whether 氂, read lí, was just a variant way of writing 犛 -- in which case 毛 "hair" would be signific -- or 毛 máo was added as a phonetic for the word máo as in máoniú "yak" -- in which case 𠩺 would be short for 犛 signific -- I don't know. Wieger (page 627) lists a character like 氂 but without 厂, pronounced lí, meaning "tail of a yak".
李氏中文字典 (page 299) marks the pronunciation 氂 lí "舊主", and the pronunciation 氂 máo "新只", which if I understand correctly means, in old times lí was the main pronunciation but now máo is the only pronunciation.
