---- 毚 [chán] (毚兔) crafty rabbit
毚 ¹¹chán b.f. ①crafty (rabbit) 毚兔 ²chántù ②greedy 毚欲 chányù
The full form 毚 is two 兔 (tù) rabbits, one above the other, the one on top being somewhat differently shaped.
"A cunning hare. Cunning, artful" --Mathews.
"Hares, rabbits; crafty, cunning" --Karlgren(1923).
"The numerous tribe of the rodents" --Wieger.
In modern Chinese 毚 generally occurs only as a phonetic component, and as such it has the simplified form  (as in 谗馋搀 etc.), which is 免 (not 兔!) with two dots beneath. However, at least in some dictionaries, the term 毚兔 'crafty rabbit' still appears; and 毚 also has the meaning 'greedy' as in 毚欲, but chán 'gluttonous, greedy' is now normally written 馋(饞), with the food radical added.
毚兔 may also be mixed up with 蟾兔, the rabbit on the moon.
