456  需 [xū] (需要 xūyào) need; ䷄; 必需 bìxū essential  [nuò] [rú] [ruǎn]
需 ³xū {C} b.f. need; want; require; requirements 需要 ¹xūyào 需求 xūqiú 军需 jūnxū
From 雨 yǔ ('rain') phonetic and 而 (ér) which depicts a beard.
It's easy to confuse 需 xū 'need' with 须 xū 'must' (as in 必须 bìxū). They are etymologically the same word, according to Karlgren(1923). To be precise, 需 and 须 are both used to write xū 'need/must', but in different compounds; they are generally not interchangeable. Karlgren says 需 probably was originally used for the word 须(鬚) xū 'beard' (as in 胡须 húxū), which explains why it contains 而.
