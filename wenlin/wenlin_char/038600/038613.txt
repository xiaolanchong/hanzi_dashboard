1919 雕 [diāo] vulture; (雕刻 diāokè) carve, engrave; 浮雕 fúdiāo relief sculpture
雕[-/鵰] ³diāo {E} n. 〈zoo.〉 vulture
雕/彫/琱 ²diāo {E} v. carve; engrave
From 周 zhōu phonetic and 隹 (zhuī) 'bird'.
The original meaning is 'vulture'; the character is borrowed for diāo 'carve' (which can also be written 彫 or 琱).
A variant form 鵰 has 鳥 instead of 隹.
