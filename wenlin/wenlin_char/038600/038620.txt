(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 杂:) Cognate with 集 jí 'collect'. Originally composed of 集 on the right and 衣 (yī) 'clothing' on the left. 集 split into 隹 and 木; 木 moved over to the left side beneath 衣; and 衣 turned into 亠 over 从, resulting in the modern full form 雜.
The simple form 杂 is derived from 雜 by omitting 隹, and replacing what was once 衣 with 九.
"Garments 衣 made 集 with variegated pieces stitched together; 从衣, 从集。五彩相合也。" --Wieger.
