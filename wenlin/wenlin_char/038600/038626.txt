From 离 lí phonetic and 隹 (zhuī) 'bird'.
The character 離 lí formerly meant 'oriole', which is now written 鹂(鸝) as in 黄鹂(鸝) huánglí 'oriole'.
Both 离 and 離 have long been used for the meaning 'leave'. 离 is now used as the simple form, 離 as the full form. Whether 'leave' was the original meaning of 离 is unclear; see 离 for picture and explanation.
