From 林 (lín) 'forest' and 疋 shū phonetic.
"Dense bushes, thorns; (dense:) rich, detailed; distinct, clear; (thorny:) sharp, painful" --Karlgren.
疋 shū is a picture of a foot, like 止 and 足. Note the 乛 hook, 疋 is not 𤴓 as in 是, 定, or 走.
楚 chǔ nearly always comes at the end of words rather than the beginning. Mostly it occurs in the word 清楚 qīngchu 'clear'.
