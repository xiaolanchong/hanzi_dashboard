(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 黄:) The oldest forms seem to depict either 大 (dà) a person, or 矢 (shǐ) an arrow, with something around the waist, or shaft. There have been numerous changes and re-interpretations (involving 田 tián 'field', 火 huǒ 'fire' etc.).
According to 郭沫若, 黄 depicted jade ornaments worn around the waist (玉佩). See 璜 huáng and 珩 héng.
