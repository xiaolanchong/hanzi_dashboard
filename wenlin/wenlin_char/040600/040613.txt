(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 麦:) The top depicts a plant; it is like 來(来) lái 'come' (with the middle vertical stroke shortened) in the full form 麥. In the simple form 麦 the top is 龶 (four strokes). The bottom is 夂 (zhǐ) 'walk slowly' (picture of a foot pointing downwards).
"The 夂 slow 來 cereal" --Karlgren.
The simple form 麦 was included in a 6th century dictionary (玉篇).
