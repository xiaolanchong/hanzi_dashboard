---- 蚤 [zǎo] 跳蚤 tiàozǎo flea  [zhǎo]
蚤 ⁵zǎo {E} b.f. flea 跳蚤 tiàozao
Composed of 叉 (chā 'fork') over 虫 (chóng) 'insect'.
"Upper part picture of a claw... the scratching 虫 insect" --Karlgren.
Cognate with 爪 zhǎo 'claw'. The upper part originally had two dots, unlike 叉 chā 'fork' which has one dot. The component with two dots seems to have been a variant of 爪 zhǎo.
Also cognate with 搔 sāo 'scratch'.
