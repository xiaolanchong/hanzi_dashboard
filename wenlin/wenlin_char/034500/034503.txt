1922 蛇 [shé] snake      [yí] 虚与委蛇  [tuó] [chí]
蛇 ¹shé {B} n. snake; serpent
蛇 ²⁰yí char. 蛇蛇 ³yíyí 委蛇 ⁴wēiyí
From 虫 (chóng) 'worm' and 它 tā 'it'.
它 depicted a cobra or python. The ancient sounds of 蛇 and 它 (now shé and tā) were similar. Apparently when 它 was borrowed to represent the word tā 'other; he, she, it', 虫 was added to 它, forming 蛇, to represent the original meaning 'snake'.
