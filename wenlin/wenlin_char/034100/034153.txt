蕩[荡] ²dàng {D} v. ①swing; shake ②loaf ③wash away ◆b.f. dissolute 放荡 fàngdàng
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 荡:) From 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' over 汤(湯) tāng phonetic.
"Vast, large; vagrant, dissolute, squander; sometimes used for (盪)" --Karlgren(1923).
Among full form characters, many words can be written with either 蕩 or 盪, which has 皿 (mǐn) 'dish' instead of 艹. Among simple full form characters, only 荡 is used.
