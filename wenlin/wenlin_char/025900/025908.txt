The modern form seems to be from 卜 bǔ and 又 (yòu) 'hand'. Karlgren says 卜 bǔ is phonetic, and 攴 is etymologically the same word as 扑 pū. However, the top doesn't look like 卜 bǔ in the old bronze form.
"A right hand equipped with a mattock or axe held high" --Lindqvist. (A mattock is an implement for digging or grubbing.)
攴 is the 66th Kangxi radical. It nearly always appears as 攵, as in 教救敕敔敝敗敏啟敘敛敢. But, in 敲 qiāo, 寇 kòu, and some rare characters, it still looks like 攴.
