From 孝 xiào 'filial piety' and 攵(攴 pū) 'beat'.
孝 xiào 'filial piety', made of 耂(老 lǎo) 'old' and 子 (zǐ) 'child', means to respect and obey ones elders; this is TAUGHT by 攵(攴 pū) beating, according to the most enlightened teaching methods.
In an old form, instead of 耂, there was 爻 yáo, which means a line of the 易经 Yìjīng Book of Changes. 爻 yáo was phonetic and also symbolized the student and teacher's "mutual action and reaction 交也; influence; symmetrical disposition, network, etc." --Wieger.
The pronunciation jiāo, first tone, occurs mainly in the single-syllable word, and in the phrase 教书 jiāoshū. In nearly all words of more than one syllable, the pronunciation is jiào, fourth tone.
教 jiāo 'teach', 觉(覺) jué 'feel' and 学(學) xué 'learn' may all be cognates.
