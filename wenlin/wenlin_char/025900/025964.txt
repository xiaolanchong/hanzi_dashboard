1253 敬 [jìng] (尊敬 zūnjìng) respect
敬 ⁶jìng {D} v. ①respect ②offer politely ◆adv. respectfully
The modern form is 苟 plus 攵 'beat'.
The left side originally derives from a slightly different character 茍 jì, one of whose meanings is 'respectful':
"The seal shows this to contain, besides 攴(攵) to beat, not 苟 gǒu but 句 and 羊: to 句 speak 羊 nicely (cf. 義, 善)" --Karlgren.
