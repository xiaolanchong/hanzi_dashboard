---- 敖 [Áo] (surname); (old form of 遨 áo stroll, saunter)  [ào]
敖 ⁷áo b.f. roam 遨游 ¹áoyóu 藏敖 zàng'áo ◆n. Surname
Originally from 出 (chū) 'go out' and 放 (fàng) 'let go'. The 出 on top of 方 was abbreviated to 土, and the dot on top of 方 was joined to the verticle line in 土, giving  over 万, so that the character 敖 is written with ten strokes. The original meaning is now written with the character 遨 áo 'ramble, travel for pleasure', which has 辶(辵 chuò) 'go' added: 辵 go 出 out and 放 relax.
