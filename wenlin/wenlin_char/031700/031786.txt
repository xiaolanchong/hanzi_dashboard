---- 簪 [zān] 髮簪 fàzān hair-pin  [zǎn]
簪 ¹zān {E} b.f. ①hairpin 簪儿 zānr 玉簪 yùzān ②wear in the hair 簪花 zānhuā
From 竹 (zhú) 'bamboo' and 朁 zǎn phonetic.
Originally written 旡 (picture of a hair-pin), but the shape was too similar to the character 旡 (jì) 'belch'. 朁 is now written 昝 Zǎn (a surname) phonetic, but while the top of 昝 has been contracted from 旡旡 into 处, the middle part of 簪 is still 旡旡.
