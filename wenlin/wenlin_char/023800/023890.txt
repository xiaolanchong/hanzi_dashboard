==== 嵒 [yán] (=岩); (also see 喦 niè)  [niè]
岩[-/巖/礹/巗/碞/嵒/嵓] ⁶yán {E} b.f. ①rock 岩石 ²yánshí ②cliff; crag (often used in place names) 悬岩 xuányán
This character may be the oldest version of 岩 yán. In the oracle bone characters, the three squares are written right at the tops of the three peaks of 山 (see 汉语大字典).
There is another character 喦 niè 'many words', which looks the same, but the radical is 口. In some fonts the center stroke of 山 goes higher in 喦 niè than in 嵒 yán.
