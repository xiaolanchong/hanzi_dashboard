2081 狹(S狭) [xiá] (狹窄 xiázhǎi, 狹隘 xiá'ài) narrow
狹[狭] ²xiá {E} attr. narrow
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 狭:) From 犭(犬 quǎn) 'dog' and 夹(夾) jiā 'squeeze'.
Cognate with 夹. Etymologically the same word as 峡 xiá 'gorge' and 狎 xiá 'disrespectful'. Seemingly 狭 contains 犭 by association with 狎.
