献[獻] ⁴xiàn {B} v. ①offer; present; donate ②show; display
The full form 獻 has on the left, not 南 (nán 'south') but 鬳 juàn 'sacrificial vessel', from 虍(虎 hǔ) 'tiger' over 鬲 (lì) 'cauldron'. The right side is 犬 (quǎn) 'dog'.
"Offer up in sacrifice or to a superior; exhibit; venerable, wise man -- to offer in a 鬳 sacrificial vessel; whether 犬 ...is phonetic or signifies the meat offered seems uncertain" --Karlgren.
It is also possible that 鬳 juàn was phonetic.
