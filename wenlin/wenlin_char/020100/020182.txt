17   他 [tā] he, him; she, her; it; (其他 qítā) other  [tuó]
他[-/牠] ¹tā* {A} pr. ①he ②she ③it ④they (referring to inanimate things in object position) | Lí dōu làn le, zuìhǎo bǎ ∼ rēng le. 梨都烂了, 最好把∼扔了。 The pears have all spoiled; better throw them away. ◆b.f. other; another 其他 qítā* 他人 tārén 他处 tāchù*
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 也 (yě 'also'). 也 may have been phonetic (the ancient sounds, now tā and yě, were similar). However, 'he, she, or it' was once written 它, then 佗, and then 他. So 他 may have been a simplification of 佗.
In spoken Chinese, pronouns have no gender. The single word tā means 'he, she, or it'. Only in modern times did somebody start writing 她 for tā 'she'. 它 tā now means 'it' exclusively.
