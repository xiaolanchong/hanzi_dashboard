No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
The 8th of the 214 radicals. 亠 apparently was never a whole character; its name tóu probably derives from 头[頭] tóu 'head', since 亠 nearly always occurs at the top of a character. In English it is called 'lid' or 'cover' for the same reason, but originally did not generally depict a lid. A popular name is 文字头 wénzìtóu, since 亠 is the 'head' of the character 文 wén.
