"从子无臂, 指事。...This character, being very easy to write, and of no use, had its primitive meaning changed into different arbitrary ones. It is now used specially to write the suffix liǎo, so frequent in the spoken language. Note the philological definition of the part it plays in that case; 发声之词, 犹言结; emission of a sound, in order to knot, to end a sentence" --Wieger.
