"The scholastic interpretaton is funny: a 人 man (now deformed 勹) exerting himself with 又 hand and 口 mouth between 二 heaven and earth!" --Karlgren(1923).
Traditionally listed under the radical 二, but now usually written with the top stroke bent, the first two strokes being like 了 (liǎo).
Phonetic in the full form of 极(極) jí, also in 殛 jí 'kill' (rare).
Probably no relation to 急 jí 'urgent', since 亟 ended in -k, and 急 ended in -p.
