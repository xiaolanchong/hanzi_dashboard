亲 qīn originally meant 'hazel-nut tree', composed of 辛 xīn phonetic and 木 (mù) 'tree', combined so that 亲 is written 立 over 木.
For the meaning 'family relation', the full form 親 has 見 (jiàn) 'see' added. The simple form is just the phonetic part 亲, which no longer means 'hazel-nut tree'. Mnemonic: "family tree".
亲 qīn is phonetic in 新 xīn 'new'.
