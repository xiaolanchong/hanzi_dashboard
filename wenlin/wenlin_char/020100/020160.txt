什 ⁹shí {E} num. ten (used in fractions, for checks, etc.) ◆b.f. assorted; various; miscellaneous 什物 ⁴shíwù ◆char. 家什 jiāshi(r) 哈什蚂 hàshimǎ
From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 十 shí 'ten'.
In the word 什么 shénme, 什 is pronounced shén. Among full form characters 甚 is sometimes used instead (甚麽 shénme or 什麽 shénme), but among simple form characters 甚 is always pronounced shèn.
什 shí is the same word as 十 'ten', and also means 'assorted, mixed', as in 素什锦 sùshíjǐn 'mixed vegetables' (compare 拾 shí which is used for 十 shí on cheques).
