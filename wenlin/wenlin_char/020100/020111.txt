亏[虧] ¹kuī* {D} v. ①lose (money/etc.); have a deficit ②treat unfairly | Wǒ cónglái méiyǒu ∼guo tā. 我从来没有∼过他。 I've never been unfair to him. ③wane ④lack ◆s.v. deficient; short ◆adv. fortunately; luckily; thanks to (sometimes mockingly) | Zhè ²shì(r) ∼ nǐ tíxǐng tā. 这事(儿)∼你提醒他。 It's fortunate that you reminded him of the matter.
The left side of the full form 虧 is 雐, from 虍 over 隹, an obsolete character representing a kind of bird, called a hú (maybe 鹄 hú swan, or 鹈鹕 tíhú pelican?); 虍 hǔ phonetic and 隹 'bird' signific. The right side is 于 yú, formerly also written 亏 yú, meaning 'exclamation'. The 于 cry of a 隹 bird is supposed to convey the idea of loss.
The simple form of 虧 is just 亏, so that now the different forms 于 and 亏 must be distinguished as seperate characters.
