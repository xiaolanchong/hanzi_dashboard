于 ¹Yú n. Surname
The vertical stroke is 亅, with a hook on the bottom; compare 干 gān which doesn't have a hook. The form 于 is "said to be a symbol of an exclamation, analogous to 丂 qiǎo and 乎 hū, cf. also 气 qì" --Karlgren.
Formerly 于 was sometimes written 亏, but 亏 is now used as the simple form of 亏(虧) kuī.
There is another character, 於 yú, which is sometimes used in place of 于 yú among full form characters. 於 is still in use among simple form characters for the surname 於 Yū.
