今 ³jīn {E} b.f. ①today 今天 jīntiān 今儿 jīnr ②the present; now 如今 rújīn*
There is no clear explanation of the shape of 今. The top  represents a cover in other characters such as 合 hé 'combine'.
Compare the characters 金 jīn 'gold' and 陰(阴) yīn 'shady', which both appear to be related to 今 jīn.
Don't confuse 今 jīn with 令 lìng 'make'.
