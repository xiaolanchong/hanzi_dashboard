2269 亨 [hēng] successful; go smoothly; henry (SI unit of inductance)  [xiǎng] [pēng]
亨 ²hēng {E} b.f. go smoothly 亨通 hēngtōng ◆n. 〈elec.〉 henry
One stroke less than 享 xiǎng. The explanation of the shape is obscure. 亨 hēng and 享 xiǎng may be related in shape, sound, and sense.
An old character had 曰 at the bottom instead of 了 or 子, and an older form possessed vertical symmetry:
"Composed of two 高 abbreviated, one being straight, the other inverted; one offering, the other receiving; 二高上下相向省。Hence two meanings: to treat with favour (now 亨 hēng) or to enjoy the favour received (now 享 xiǎng)" --Wieger.
The meaning of 亨 hēng, 'go smoothly' is not very far from the supposed old meaning 'treat with favour'. The meaning 'henry' is of course a loan from English.
