Originally written , the same as 已 yǐ 'already'.
"This very ancient character is supposed to represent the exhalation of the breath, the virtue that emanates from any object, its action, its use. By extension, use till exhaustion, to terminate..." --Wieger.
 also came to be written  yǐ, which is an obsolete synonym of 以. Then  was reduced to 厶, slightly distorted into 𠄌 plus 丶, and for the meaning "use as, consider as", 人 rén 'person' was added to the right side, resulting in 以.
以 yǐ is phonetic in 似 sì.
