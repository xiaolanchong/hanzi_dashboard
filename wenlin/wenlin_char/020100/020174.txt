从[從] ¹⁰cōng char. 黑从从 hēicōngcōng
Two 人 (rén) people, one following the other. The full form 從 has 彳 (chì) 'footprint' and (止 zhǐ) 'foot' added for emphasis. But the simple form 从 is older. Compare 比 bǐ and 众 zhòng.
從 has also been used as a variant of 纵(縱) zòng.
In 从容 cóngróng 'calm', the modern standard pronunciation is cóng, not cōng.
