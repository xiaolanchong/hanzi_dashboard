According to Shuōwén, 發 is from 弓 (gōng) 'bow' and 癹 phonetic. Another explanation is that 癶 bò is phonetic, and 殳 (shū) means to launch arrows with the 弓 bow. (癶 also suggests the meaning: two 止 feet, "separation, divergence, letting loose" --Wieger). An old form 𤼵 had 矢 shǐ 'arrow' instead of 殳.
The simple form 发 is equivalent to either 發 fā 'emit' or 髮 fà 'hair'.
