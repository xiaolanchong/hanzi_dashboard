1774 症 [zhèng] disease; 健忘症 amnesia  [zhēng] (F癥) 症结
症[-/證] ⁵zhèng {D} b.f. ①disease; illness 病症 bìngzhèng* ②symptoms 症状 zhèngzhuàng*
症[癥] ¹³zhēng b.f. abdominal tumor 症结 zhēngjié
From 疒 (nì) 'sick' and 正 zhèng phonetic.
症 zhèng is probably etymologically the same word as 证(證): evidence: symptom: disease. The character 症 dates from the Sòng dynasty, and among full form characters 證 is still sometimes used in place of 症.
In the first tone, 症 zhēng has the full form 癥, with 徵 zhēng phonetic, and it occurs in zhēngjié 'crux; obstruction of the bowels', and zhēngjiǎ 'concretion'. Earlier versions of Wenlin (through 3.0) mistakenly gave 癥 as the full form of 症 regardless of pronunciation or meaning.
