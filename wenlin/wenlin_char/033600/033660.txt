---- 荼 [tú] bitter plant  [chá] [yé] [shū]
荼 ⁶tú {E} b.f. a bitter edible plant 荼毒 ¹túdú* 茹荼 rútú
From 艹(草 cǎo) 'herb' and 余 yú phonetic.
This was originally the same character as 茶 chá "tea", and the same word. Notice the difference: 茶 has one less horizontal stroke than 荼. Now the pronunciations have drifted apart, and 荼 tú is a rare word for certain plants, while 茶 chá is the very common word for tea.
