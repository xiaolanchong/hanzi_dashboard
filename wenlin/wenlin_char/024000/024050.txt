" a symbol the analysis of which is uncertain, but which is said to indicate an exhalation, an outcry (and serves in this sense e.g. in 牟 móu): hough! voila! it's finished!" --Karlgren.
 also changed to , 厶, and (with 人 added), 以 yǐ. So 已 yǐ 'already' is cognate with 以 yǐ 'use as'. The meanings may have evolved from the primitive meaning 'use':
 use --> 以 use as, consider as;
 use --> 已 used up, finished, already.
已 yǐ is not to be confused with 己 jǐ or 巳 sì.
