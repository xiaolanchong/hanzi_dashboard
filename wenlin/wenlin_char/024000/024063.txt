==== 巿 [fú] (archaic:) knee covers  [pó] (archaic:) abundant vegetation
No common single-syllable words.
The shape 巿 has obscure origins. The important thing is to distinguish it from 市 shì. 巿 fú has only four strokes, whereas 市 shì has five.
"Knee cover -- a 巾 piece of cloth attached by a 一 ribbon" --Karlgren(1923). (An ancient ceremonial garment.)
"Picture of lianas" --Karlgren(1923). (Possibly, originally a different character from 'knee cover'. See 芾 fú).
Supposedly, this component also occurs in the form 十 over 冂 in 南 nán, 索 suǒ and 孛 bó; the right-hand element of 姊 and 秭 may also derive from 巿.
