---- 巽 [xùn] ☴ ䷸ The Gentle (The Penetrating, Wind)  [zhuàn]
巽 ¹¹xùn n. one of the eight trigrams ◆char. 巽言 xùnyán
Two 巳(=卩) seals, two  hands, and a 兀 table.
Karlgren gives no explanation, but gives the definition "mild, bland, humble, insinuating", and says that 巽 is phonetic in 选(選) xuǎn 'choose'.
Wieger, on the other hand, gives 巽 the meaning of 選 ('choose'), and makes no mention of the trigram ☴ meaning 'gentle, wind':
"To elect, to choose. Two 卩 seals of officials, placed upon a 兀 table, to be committed to those who were elected, chosen. Later on, the two hands  were added to mean the awarding, the investiture. In the modern character,  and 兀 were joined together, gave 共, which has nothing in common with 共 gòng; 从兀, 从。会意。This character is seldom seen well written."
