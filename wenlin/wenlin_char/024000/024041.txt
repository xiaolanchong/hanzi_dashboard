1526 巩(F鞏) [gǒng] 巩固 gǒnggù consolidate
巩[鞏] ³gǒng {E} b.f. consolidate; make firm 巩固 gǒnggù* ◆n. Surname
The original meaning was 'embrace'.
The left side is 工 gōng ('work') phonetic. The right side looked like a person reaching out with both hands; now it happens to look like 凡 (fán 'ordinary').
In the full form 鞏, 革 (gé) 'leather' has been added to the bottom to emphasize the meaning 'bind'.
