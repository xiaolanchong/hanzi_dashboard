1574 臣 [chén] subject; (大臣 dàchén) minister
臣 ⁴chén {E} n. ①subject (vs. ruler) ②〈trad.〉 official ◆pr. 〈trad./humb.〉 I
The original meaning was 'slave'. 臣 is an eye drawn sideways (臣 chén has always been drawn sideways, unlike 目 mù 'eye' which used to be right-side up: 罒). It depicts the eye of a slave who must always bow down, never looking the master straight in the eye.
Don't confuse 臣 chén with 巨 jù 'big' or 𦣞 yí 'chin'.
臣 is simplified to two strokes at the left sides of the components (臤) jiān and (监監) jiān, which appear in lots of simple form characters: 坚鉴蓝篮览贤竖肾紧 etc. Compare刂(刀 dāo) 'knife' which always occurs on the RIGHT side.
