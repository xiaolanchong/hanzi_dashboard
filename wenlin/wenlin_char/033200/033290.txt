782  舊(S旧) [jiù] old (not new) (cf 老 old, not young; 新 new)
舊[旧] ²jiù {A} s.v. ①past; bygone; old ②used; worn; old ③former; onetime ◆n. old friendship/friend
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 旧:) The full form 舊 is 艹 over 隹 over 臼. The original meaning was 'owl': a 隹 (zhuī) bird with 艹 feather-horns (really 雈, slightly different on top from 萑). 臼 jiù ('mortar') is phonetic. The character was borrowed for the word jiù 'old' which happened to sound the same.
臼 jiù is difficult to write well in a hurry, so in handwriting it can come out like 丨 plus 日. Then for the simple form 旧, 艹 and 隹 were dropped altogether from 舊. (臼 jiù meaning 'mortar' retains its full form.)
