康熙字典 puts the full form 與 under radical 134 臼, with 8 residual strokes, which I find incomprehensible. The Unihan database gives its total stroke count as 14, which is also strange. 汉语大字典 puts 與 under radical 12 八, with 11 residual strokes, for a total of 13 strokes.
Compare 興, which 康熙字典 puts under 臼 with 9 residual strokes. This implies that only  and  (7 strokes) are considered the radical part. In this case, to be consistent with the modern stroke count of 13 for 與, the residual stroke count of 與 is 6. Probably 康熙字典 treated the central bent stroke (the 6th stroke in the whole character) as three separate strokes. (Then Unihan should say the total stroke count is 15, not 14!)
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 与:) Originally from 一 (yī) 'one' and 勺 (sháo) 'spoon'. The meaning was 'give, grant'; possibly to give one spoonful of food to a child.
The full form 與 was made by adding 舁 yú 'lift' (two pairs of hands) to 与. 舁 yú was phonetic; two pairs of hands also could depict the giver and the receiver.
Compare 兴(興) xìng (the full forms are similar).
