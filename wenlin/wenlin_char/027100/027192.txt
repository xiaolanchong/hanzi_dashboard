樸[朴] ³pǔ {E} b.f. simple; plain 朴素 ¹pǔsù* 淳朴 ¹chúnpǔ
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 朴:) From 木 (mù) 'tree' and 卜 bǔ phonetic. 朴 pǔ as in 朴素 pǔsù is simplified from 樸 (with 菐 pú as the phonetic). However, 朴 is the original (not simplified) form for the other readings:
朴 pò as in 朴树 pòshù 'Chinese hackberry';
朴 pō as in 朴刀 pōdāo 'two-handed sword'; and
朴 Piáo a surname.
