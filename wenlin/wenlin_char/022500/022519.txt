(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 执:) The left side 幸 (simplified to 扌) depicted handcuffs, and the right side 丸 depicted a person whose hands are locked in the handcuffs.
No relation to 丸 wán 'pellet'. Whether there is a historical relation to 幸 xìng 'lucky' is unclear.
热(熱) rè and 势(勢) shì are from 埶 yì, not from 执(執).
