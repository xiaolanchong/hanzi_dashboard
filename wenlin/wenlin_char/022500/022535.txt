==== 堇 [jǐn] 堇菜 violet (flower); 三色堇 pansy  [qín] [jìn]
堇 ⁸jǐn n. 〈bot.〉 violet
The history of 堇 is messy. First of all, when it means 'violet', 堇 jǐn really is from 艹(草 cǎo) 'plant'. Where it is used as a component in other characters, 堇 has a different origin: it is related to , and it may have meant 'clay'.
Compare 紫色 zǐsè 'violet color'.
