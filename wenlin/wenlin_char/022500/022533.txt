(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 坚:) Originally written 臤, 臣 (chén) 'subject' (as opposed to 君 jūn 'prince'), plus 又 (yòu) 'hand'. The meaning is for a prince to have his 臣 subjects firmly in 又 hand. To emphasize the meaning of solidity, 土 (tǔ) 'earth' was added, forming 堅. In the simple form 坚, 臣 is reduced to two vertical strokes (the form 坚 is at least 800 years old).
臤 (or ) is a phonetic component in 紧(緊) jǐn 'tight' and 贤(賢) xián 'virtuous'. It is a signific component in 肾(腎) shèn 'kidneys' and 竖(豎) shù 'upright'.
