==== 埯(F垵) [ǎn] hole for seeds; dibble  [yǎn]
埯[垵] ²ǎn n. hole to sow seeds in ◆v. dibble ◆m. (for dibbling crops)
From 土 (tǔ) 'earth' and 奄 yǎn or 安 ān phonetic.
This is one of those absurd cases where the "simple" form 埯 is more complex than the "full" form 垵. We designate them this way because only 埯 is included in the GB standard (for 简体字) and only 垵 is included in the Big5 standard (for 繁体字).
