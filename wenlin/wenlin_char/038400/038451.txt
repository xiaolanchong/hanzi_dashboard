Originally 昜: the 日 (rì) sun with 勿 rays coming down. 阝(阜 fù) 'hill' was added to make the full form 陽. The simple form 阳 is just 阝 plus 日: the 日 sunny side of a 阝 hill.
As a component, 昜 becomes 𠃓 in simple form characters; it is phonetic in 扬(揚) yáng, 汤(湯) tāng, etc.
昜 is unrelated to 易 yì 'easy'.
