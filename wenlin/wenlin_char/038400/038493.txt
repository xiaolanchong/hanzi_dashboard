2375 陝(S陕) [Shǎn] 陝西省 Shaanxi Province
陝[陕] Shǎn ab. Shǎnxī
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 陕:) From 阝(阜 fù) 'hill' and 夹(㚒). The right side was originally not quite the same as 夹(夾) jiā 'squeeze', but another character 㚒 shǎn 'thief' (now obsolete) that was phonetic. The full form 陝 should be written with the doubled component (under the arms of 大) more like 入 rù than 人 rén. (Compare 陜 xiá.)
When written in Romanization without tone marks, Shaanxi is spelled with double "a" to distinguish it from Shānxī 山西.
