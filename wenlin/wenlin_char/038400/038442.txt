==== 阪(S坂) [bǎn] slope; rugged and barren place
阪[坂] ³bǎn n. 〈wr.〉 slope
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 坂:) From 土 (tǔ) 'earth' or 阝(阜 fù) 'hill' and 反 fǎn phonetic.
(Note: we treat 坂 as the "simple form" and 阪 as the "full form", only because 坂 is in the GB standard and 阪 is in the Big5 standard. This is one of those absurd cases where the simple form has more strokes than the full form!)
