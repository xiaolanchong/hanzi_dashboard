(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 厘:) The full form 釐 is composed of 𠩺 lí phonetic and 里 lǐ 'mile, village'. Presumably 里 is signific ('mile' suggests the notion of measurement), since normally a character doesn't have two phonetic parts.
"To regulate; give; a thousandth (especially of a 兩 and a 畝); a kind of excise duty; a cash" --Kargren.
The simple form 厘 is 厂 over 里. The simple form 厘 is used to some extent even among full form characters.
