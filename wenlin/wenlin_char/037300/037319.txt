616  采 [cǎi] pick, gather (F採)  [cài] (F埰) 采地 càidì fief
采[-/採] ²cǎi {B} v. ①pick; gather ②mine ③select ◆b.f. ①variegated color ②facial color and expression; spirit 神采 shéncǎi
采[埰/寀] ²cài b.f. fief; benefice 采邑 càiyì 采地 ²càidì
From 爫 (zhǎo) 'hand' and 木 (mù) 'tree'.
A 爫 hand reaching to pick fruit from a 木 tree (in the oracle bone character, fruits were shown on the tree, just like 果 guǒ).
Etymologically the same word as 彩 cǎi 'multi-color' (various colors specially gathered), and cognate with 菜 cài 'vegetables, greens' (picked from the ground).
采 has eight strokes, not to be confused with the component 釆 biàn which has only seven strokes. Strangely, however, the radical of 采 cǎi is 釆 biàn, not 爪 zhǎo.
A variant form is 採 ("tautologically enlarged by 手" --Karlgren), which among full form characters is interchangeable with 采 in many (though not all) contexts.
For cài as in càidì and càiyì 'fief', the variant forms 埰 and 寀, with 土 'earth' or 宀 'roof' added, are interchangeable with 采 among full form characters.
