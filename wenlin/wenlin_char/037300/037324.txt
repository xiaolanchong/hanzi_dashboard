From 田 (tián) 'field' and 土 (tǔ) 'earth'.
“Village of 25 or 50 families; place of residence; (the length of the side of the said village:) length measure of about 600 meters” --Karlgren.
Since the adoption of the metric system, a lǐ is exactly 500 meters.
The word lǐ meaning 'inside' in its full form is written with 里 and 衣 (yī) 'clothing', either 裏, split with 亠 on top and the rest below, or 裡, with 衤(衣) on the left side. The simple form is just 里 without 衣.
