量 is composed of 日 (rì) 'sun' over 一 (yī) 'one' over 里 (lǐ) 'half kilometer'. The distance to the 日 sun has been 量 measured: it is exactly 一 one 里 li away. This is astronomically and etymologically absurd, but it might help you remember the character.
The true explanation is obscure. The bottom is from 重 zhòng 'heavy', which is a picture of a weighing machine. The top 日 might be an object being weighed, or a contraction of 良 liáng phonetic.
In dictionaries you will often see the character 量 used as an abbreviation for 量词 liàngcí measure word, or classifier, an important part of speech in Chinese (like 个, 枝, 匹, etc).
