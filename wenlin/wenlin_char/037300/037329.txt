The bottom apparently came from 土 (tǔ) 'earth' and (dots:) gold nuggets.
The top was at one time 今 jīn phonetic, but before that it may have been part of the picture of gold covered up in the ground.
金 occurs as a component on the left side of characters, written (full form:) 釒 or (simple form:) 钅, usually suggesting that the meaning is related to metal.
