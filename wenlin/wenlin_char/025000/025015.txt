==== 憷 [chù] to fear, shrink from  [chǔ] painful
憷 ⁵chù {E} v. fear; shrink from
From 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' and 楚 chǔ phonetic.
Compare 怵 chù 'fear'. The two words 怵 and 憷 are pronounced quite differently from each other in Cantonese. Therefore it appears to be incorrect to consider these as variant characters for the same morpheme. Nevertheless, only 怵 (not 憷) is included in the Big5 standard and in the Far East Chinese-English Dictionary (Taiwan, 1995). That dictionary writes 怵場 rather than 憷場 for chùchǎng 'have stage fright'.
