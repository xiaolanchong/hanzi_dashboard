---- 懋 [mào] diligent; luxuriant, profuse, lush
懋 ⁷mào b.f. diligent 懋绩 màojì
From 楙 mào 'luxuriant' and 心 (xīn) 'heart'.
The top 楙, itself composed of 矛 máo phonetic in the middle of 林 (lín) 'forest', is an old variant form of 茂 mào as in 茂盛 màoshèng 'luxuriant'.
心 (xīn) 'heart' was added for the meaning 'diligent', 楙 mào being phonetic. But now 懋 is used more for the original meaning of 楙 and 茂 'luxuriant'.
