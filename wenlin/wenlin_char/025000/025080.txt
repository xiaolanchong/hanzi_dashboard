(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 悬:) From 县(縣) xiàn ('county') over 心 (xīn) 'heart'.
县(縣) originally meant 'hang'; it depicted a person's head hanging upside down from a rope on a tree; now it is pronounced xiàn and means 'county'. 心 (xīn) 'heart' was added to the character to convey the extended meaning 'worry', and now 悬(懸) with 心 (xīn) 'heart' added is also used for the basic meaning 'hang'.
