貞[贞] ⁷zhēn {E} b.f. ①loyal; faithful 坚贞 ¹jiānzhēn* ②chastity 贞德 zhēndé
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 贞:) From 卜 (bǔ) 'fortune telling' and 贝(貝 bèi) 'money'.
"Enquire by divination; auspicious; good, virtuous; firm, solid; chaste, pure -- from 卜 divination and 貝 (fee to the diviner?)" --Karlgren(1923).
Karlgren(1940) says 貞 was originally a simplified way of writing 鼎 dǐng 'cauldron', borrowed as a phonetic loan.
