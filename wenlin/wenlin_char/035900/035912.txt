1864 豈(S岂) [qǐ] (rhetorical adverb); 豈有此理 preposterous  [kǎi]
豈[岂] ²qǐ {E} adv. 〈wr.〉 how could ...? | ∼ néng bù guǎn! ∼能不管! How could we not take care of sth./sb.?
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 岂:) The full form 豈 is 山 over 豆. Nothing to do with 山 shān 'mountain' or 豆 dòu 'bean', 豈 was allegedly a picture of a drum, like 壴 (鼓 gǔ).
The simple form 岂 is 山 over 己 jǐ phonetic.
岂(豈) is phonetic in 凯剀垲恺铠(凱剴塏愷鎧) kǎi.
