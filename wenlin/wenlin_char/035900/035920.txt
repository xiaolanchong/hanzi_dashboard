884  豐(S丰) [fēng] ䷶ Abundance; 豐富 fēngfù abundant
豐[丰] ⁹fēng {E} b.f. plentiful; bounteous 丰富 fēngfù* 丰收 fēngshōu*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 丰:) The form on the far left, four strokes, is the oldest:
"Picture of a blossom, a bouquet" --Karlgren.
"Some philologists say that this character is 生, that strikes down its tap root; 从生上下达, 指事。The study of the compounds makes this opinion improbable. 丰 is a primitive, representing a leafy bough." --Wieger.
It was doubled (second form from right), then various things were added; the full form 豐 has 丰 doubled over 山 and 豆. However, for the meaning "good-looking", the simple form 丰 is used even among full form characters.
The simple form 丰 is the same as the oldest form, except that the top line is straightened out.
