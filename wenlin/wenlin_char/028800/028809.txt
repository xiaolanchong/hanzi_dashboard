1765 炉(F爐) [lú] (炉子 lúzi) stove, oven, furnace
炉[爐] ¹lú {E} b.f. stove; furnace 炉子 lúzi ◆m. (for fires in stoves (for heating)) | Tài lěng le, shēng liǎng ∼ huǒ ba. 太冷了, 生两∼火吧。 It is too cold; let's have two fires.
Once written 盧; then 盧 was borrowed for a surname Lú, and 火 (huǒ) 'fire' was added to make 爐. The simple form 炉 has 户 (hù) in place of 盧 (NOT 卢 lú as might be expected).
