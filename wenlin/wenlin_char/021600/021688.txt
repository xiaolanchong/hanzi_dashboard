咸 ¹¹xián adv. 〈wr.〉 all
The character 咸, from 戌 (xū) 'destroy' and 口 (kǒu) 'mouth', originally meant 'bite'.
"戌 to hurt 口 with the mouth" --Karlgren.
Then 咸 was borrowed for a word meaning 'all, entirely' (now rare), which happened to be pronounced the same. 咸 xián is also the name of the hexagram ䷞, variously translated as 'Influence' (Legge), 'Wooing' (Wilhelm), and 'Cutting' (Kerson Huang).
The full form for xián 'salty' is 鹹, composed of 鹵 (lǔ) 'salt' and 咸 xián phonetic. 鹹 is simplified to 咸 by dropping 鹵, so now 咸 most commonly occurs as the simple form for xián 'salty'.
