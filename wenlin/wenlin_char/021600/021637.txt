xxxx 咅 [pǒu] ('spit out'; phonetic component in 部倍培陪剖...) [tòu]

In modern Chinese 咅 only occurs as a phonetic component, indicating the sounds of 部 bù, 倍 bèi, 培 péi, 剖 pōu, etc.
口 kǒu 'mouth' indicated the meaning 'spit out'. The top was not 立 lì 'stand', but a variant of 不 bù, phonetic (according to Karlgren), with a dot on top. See the old form 㕻. An alternative explanation is that 咅 derives somehow from 否 fǒu.
咅 is also used for a synonymous word pronounced tòu. However, it is not a common character in modern Chinese.
