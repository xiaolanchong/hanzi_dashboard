==== 咤(F吒) [zhà] 叱咤 chìzhà shout, yell
咤[吒] ⁹zhà char. 咤食 zhàshí 叱咤 chìzhà 赫咤 ²hèzhà
From 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' and 宅 zhái or 乇 tuō phonetic.
This is one of those absurd cases where the "simple" form (咤) is more complex than the "full" form (吒). We designate them this way because only 吒 is included in the Big5 standard (for 繁体字). (Both 咤 and 吒 are included in the GB standard, but with the pronunciation zhà, 咤 is standard in simple form orthography -- 吒 is used only with the pronunciation zhā and only in the names of mythical beings.)
