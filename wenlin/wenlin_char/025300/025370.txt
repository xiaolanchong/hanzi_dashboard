2865 挚(F摯) [zhì] 真挚 zhēnzhì true, sincere
挚[摯] ²⁰zhì {E} b.f. sincere 真挚 ¹zhēnzhì 挚友 ¹zhìyǒu
From 执(執) zhí 'hold in the hand' over 手 (shǒu) 'hand'.
Cognate to 执 zhí, but 挚 zhì has the falling tone. While 挚 also had the sense of "grasp, hold", in the modern language it is commonly used only in compound words like 真挚 zhēnzhì 'sincere'.
Like 执(執), 挚(摯) has 幸 rather than 扌 in the full form.
