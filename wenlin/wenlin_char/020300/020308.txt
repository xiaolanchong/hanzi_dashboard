---- 佔 [zhàn] (=占) occupy  [chān] [diān]
占/佔 ²zhàn {A} v. ①occupy; take; possess ②constitute; make up; account for | Zhōngfāng ∼ gǔfèn de sì ²fēnzhī sān. 中方∼股份的四分之三。 The Chinese side controls three quarters of the shares.
The form 佔 is sometimes used in place of 占 zhàn 'occupy' among full form characters but not in place of 占 zhān 'fortune telling' (notice that the tones are different as well as the meanings).
However, the form 占 is also commonly used for zhàn 'occupy' among full form characters, in free variation with 佔.
Only 占 is used for both zhàn and zhān among simple form characters.
