From 日, representing a lump of clay, and 土 (tǔ) 'earth'.
The top 日 is sometimes changed to 臼 (jiù) 'mortar', and the bottom is sometimes changed to 工 (gōng 'work'), which is "erroneous" according to Karlgren. The characters 隉 (full form of 陧 niè) and 揑 (variant of 捏 niē) have similarities with 毁 (huǐ) 'destroy'.
