(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 并:) Both forms 并 and 並 originally depicted two people side by side. 并 (or 幷) derives from 从 two people with 二 horizontal lines indicating that they are on the same level. (Compare 幵 qiān 'level, even'.) 並 derives from 竝, which is 立 (lì) 'stand' doubled: two people standing together.
The two characters 并 and 並 formerly were regarded as distinct; Karlgren(1923) says they were cognate words but not identical. Now the 汉字正字手册 says they are to be regarded as a single character, uniformly written 并.
When the two forms 并 and 並 are distinguished, the verb is written with 并, or its more complex variant 併 (or 倂), while the adverb and conjunction are written with 並, as are most of the common compound words.
