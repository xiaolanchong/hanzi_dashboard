么 originated as another way of writing 幺 (yāo) 'small', depicting two tiny silk cocoons. Another word meaning 'small' is 麽 or 麼 mó, written with 么 or 幺 plus 麻 má phonetic on top.
The second syllable of the modern words shénme 'what', zěnme 'how', nàme 'so', etc., also came to be written with the character 麽 or 麼.
Now among simple form characters, 么 is used instead of 麽 in 那么 nàme etc., but 麽 is used in the word 幺麽 yāomó 'insignificant'.
On the other hand, among full form characters, 麼 is used for writing 那麼 nàme etc., and 么 is used to write yāo in 么麼 yāomó 'insignificant'.
