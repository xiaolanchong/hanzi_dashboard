The original meaning was 'unravel':
"爪又 two hands working with 幺 silk threads hung up on 冂 a stand" --Karlgren.
乚 was added to represent one of the threads. The simplification of the left side to 舌 is at least a thousand years old (广韵). The meaning has drifted from 'unravel' to 'disorder'. Although 乱 was not really derived from 舌 shé 'tongue', one might construe sticking one's 舌 tongue out as a form of 乱 disorderly conduct.
