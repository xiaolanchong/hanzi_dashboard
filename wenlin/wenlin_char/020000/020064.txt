The full form 習 is 羽 over 白. The bottom was 自 zì, but from early times it was written with one less stroke so it looks like 白 bái.
羽 yǔ represents wings; 自 zì is a picture of a nose, and means 'self', hence 習:
"Young birds learning to fly; to practise; be familiar with; custom -- the seal has 自 below: use ones 自 own 羽 wings" --Karlgren.
Wieger says 自 here means "Starting point, the origin, beginning, evolution; the nose being, according to the Chinese embryology, the starting point of the bodily evolution". Hence 習:
"The 自(contracted) first attempts to 羽 fly, made by a young bird; 从羽, 从自, 会意。By extension, to repeat the same act, to practice."
The simple form 习 is just half of 羽: one wing.
