==== 丶 [zhǔ] radical 3  [diǎn] (component: 'dot'; 点 diǎn)

A single dot. The third of the 214 radicals.
The pronunciation zhǔ derives from association with 主 zhǔ, which formerly could be written as a single dot 丶.
The pronunciation diǎn (点) describes a dot, especially in the context of the standard system of five stroke types: 一 héng, 丨 shù, 丿 piě, 丶 diǎn, and 乛 zhé. In this system, the fourth type 丶 diǎn includes  nà (捺) which is the last stroke in 火 (huǒ 'fire'). It also includes a left-falling dot like the first stroke in 火. (The second and third strokes in 火 are both 丿 piě.) The first stroke in 冖 (mì 'cover') is also diǎn, not piě.
