丹 ²dān {D} n. 〈Ch. med.〉 pellet; powder ◆attr. red
'Cinnabar' is red mercuric sulfide, a mineral. It is made into red pigment.
The 丶 dot in the middle is said to depict a piece of cinnabar. According to 说文 Shuōwén, the frame around it, resembling 井 jǐng 'well', represents the mine from which the cinnabar is taken. Other theories: 丹 depicts cinnabar in "the crucible of the Taoist alchemists" (--Wieger), or "placed in a tray or palette to be used as red pigment" (--王宏源).
丹 is traditionally listed in dictionaries under 丶 the 'dot' radical.
The bottom of 青 qīng 'green' was originally 丹.
