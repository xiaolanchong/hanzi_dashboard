==== 丿 [piě] (radical 4; component: left curving stroke; 撇 piě)  [yì]
No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
A single stroke falling to the left, pointed at the tip.
Fourth of the 214 radicals.
Third of the five standard stroke types: 一 héng, 丨 shù, 丿 piě, 丶 diǎn, and 乛 zhé.
It is important to distinguish 丿 piě from a left-falling dot (diǎn). For example, 火 (huǒ 'fire') is written diǎn, piě, piě, nà. The first stroke of 火 is considered to be diǎn, because it is short and fat and doesn't fall to a pointed tip at the left side. The first stroke in 冖 (mì 'cover') is also diǎn, not piě.
