2394 乖 [guāi] clever; (乖乖 guāiguāi) obedient, well-behaved
乖 ¹guāi {C} s.v. ①well-behaved | Nǐ de háizi zhēn ∼. 你的孩子真∼。 Your child is so well-behaved. ②clever; shrewd ◆b.f. ①perverse; contrary to reason 乖谬 guāimiù ②oppose; be at variance 乖离 guāilí
乖 guāi has several meanings which don't seem to fit together: 'well-behaved'; 'clever'; and 'perverse' (as in 乖戾 guāilì). Karlgren says primitive meaning was 'backbone': "Backbone; turn the back on, obstinate; perverse, wicked, strange, cunning".
The shape is supposed to be from the top of 羊, plus 八 doubled: "Ramified (twice 八, division) ram's horns; odd, singular; 从..., 从重 八 , 分也。The modern character is absurd..." --Wieger.
No connection, then, with 千 qiān or 北 běi. Anyway, the meaning 'well-behaved' seems like a non sequitur, unless it derives from the meaning 'clever'.
