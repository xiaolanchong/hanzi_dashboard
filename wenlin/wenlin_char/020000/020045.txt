"从兦, 从一, 指事。It is 兦, plus 一. But the line 一 representing an obstacle, as in 丂, the meaning of zhà is, to try to hide one's self and to be hindered. Hence the modern meanings zhuǎnzhù, suddenly, unexpectedly" --Wieger.
兦 is the old form of 亡 wáng 'disappear'.
A completely different explanation (see Henshall) is that 乍 depicted an adze chopping wood.
乍 zhà is a component in 作昨窄炸榨咋诈柞怍胙祚 etc.
