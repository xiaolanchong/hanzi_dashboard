"The 日 sun rising behind the trees of the  jungle... enlarged by 乙 the meaning of which is uncertain" --Karlgren.
Compare 朝 cháo zhāo. No connection with 乞 qǐ 'beg'.
As a full form, 乾 is also used for gān 'dry' (warmth of the 日 sun). Among simple form characters, 干 is used for gān 'dry'.
The older version of 乾, without 乙, is phonetic in 幹, which is the full form of 干 gàn 'do'.
