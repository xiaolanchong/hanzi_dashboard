"An ancient character the reading and sense of which are obscure. It is said to depict a double door closed by a bar at the top. As it functions sometimes as alternate form for the similar 酉 as a cyclical character it is alleged to have been read yǒu, which, however, is not confirmed by the phonetic series" --Karlgren.
By "phonetic series" Karlgren means 柳 liǔ, 留 liú, 劉(刘) Liú and 聊 liáo. But the distinction between 丣 and 卯 mǎo, and the graphical variant , seems not to have existed in the oldest characters. So possibly this phonetic series should be merged with the characters 贸 mào, 铆 mǎo, 峁 mǎo, 昴 Mǎo, 泖 mǎo and 茆 máo, if the alternation between M and L can be explained.
