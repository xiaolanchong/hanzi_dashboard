Another character, 澱, with 殿 diàn phonetic, has often been treated as interchangeable with 淀. Now among full form characters 澱 is used more with the meaning "sediment", while 淀 is used with the meaning "shallow water". Only 淀 is used among simple form characters.
Both 淀 and 澱 have been used for the word diàn 'indigo', but the more standard way to write it is 靛.
