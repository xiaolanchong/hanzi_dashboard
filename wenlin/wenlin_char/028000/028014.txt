1502 浮 [fú] float
浮 ¹fú {B} v. ①float ②exceed; be superfluous ③〈topo.〉 swim ◆s.v. ①flighty; unstable ②temporary; provisional ③hollow; inflated ④excessive; surplus
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 孚 fú.
说文 Shuówén has an old form composed of 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 子, without 爫, related to 游 yóu 'swim': then 子 is not a child but a person whose legs are invisible in the 氵 water. The addition of 爫 makes it a "nonsensical compound", says Wieger. But apparently 浮 is composed of 氵 'water' and 孚 fú phonetic, which does make sense.
