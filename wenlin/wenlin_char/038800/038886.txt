2529 韦(F韋) [wéi] soft leather; (surname)
韦[韋] ⁸wéi b.f. leather 韦带 wéidài 佩韦 pèiwéi ◆n. Surname
Originally 囗 wéi 'surround' (possibly depicting city walls), surrounded by two right feet, the foot on top pointing to the left, the foot on the bottom pointing to the right. The full form 韋 is nine strokes. The simple form 韦 is four strokes.
The character was borrowed for the meaning 'soft leather' which happened to have the same pronunciation; the original meaning may be preserved in 围(圍) wéi 'surround', 违(違) wéi 'go against' and 卫(衛) wèi 'defend'.
韦, or 韋, is the 178th of the 214 radicals.
