==== 韱 [qián] (wild onion -- obsolete; component in 谶殲...)  [xiān]
No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
From 从 (cóng) 'two people', 戈 (gē) 'lance' and 韭 (jiǔ) 'chives'.
The combination 从 plus 戈 is an obsolete character which was an alternative way of writing 尖 jiān 'sharp':
"从 two men and 戈 a lance" --Karlgren.
This obsolete character 从 plus 戈 was a phonetic component in 韱 qián. 韱 qián itself is now obsolete, but it occurs as a phonetic component in 谶 and 殲.
