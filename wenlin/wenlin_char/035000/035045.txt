==== 裥(F襉) [jiǎn] pleats or creases in clothing
裥[襉/襇] ¹⁶jiǎn b.f. pleat 折裥机 zhéjiǎnjī 胖裥 pàngjiǎn
From 衤(衣 yī) 'clothing' and 间(閒 or 間) jiān phonetic.
There are two full forms: 襉 (with 閒) and 襇 (with 間). We treat 襉 as the standard full form since only 襉 (not 襇) is included in the Taiwan Big5 character set.
