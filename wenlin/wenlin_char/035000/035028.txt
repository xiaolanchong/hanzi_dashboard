From 衣 yī 'clothing'.
裔 yì is cognate with 衣 yī. The lower part happens to resemble the lower part of 商 shāng, and the old character 冏 jiǒng.
"Lower edge of a robe, train; border, frontier; descendants -- analysis of lower part uncertain; some old variants (see Kāngxī) seem to show that it is simply a picture of a train" --Karlgren.
