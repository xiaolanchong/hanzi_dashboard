(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 够:) From 句 jù phonetic and 多 (duō) 'much', sometimes in reverse order.
(We call 够 the "simple" form and 夠 the "full" form, only because 够 is in the simple-form GB standard and 夠 is in the full-form Big5 standard.)
The more complex character 彀 gòu is also sometimes used instead of 够.
