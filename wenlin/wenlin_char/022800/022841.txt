The full form 夾 is 大 between two 人:
"To press from two sides, squeeze; double, lined -- a 大 man squeezing 从 two other men under his arms" --Karlgren.
"Three people can be seen; in the middle, a big one with outstretched arms, and on either side, two smaller people in profile who are doing their best to support and help" --Lindqvist.
Who's squeezing whom? The little people look like children.
The simple form 夹 is one stroke less.
Cognate to 挟 xié. Don't confuse with 来(來) lái.
