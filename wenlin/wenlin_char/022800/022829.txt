2981 夭 [yāo] (夭亡 yāowáng, 夭折 yāozhé) die young  [wò] [wāi]
夭 ⁷yāo {E} b.f. die young 夭折 yāozhé 早夭 zǎoyāo
Picture of a 大 person with 丿 head bent.
"Bent, delicate, tender; young, fresh, beautiful -- man with head bent down; the word is cognate to (幺 and 幼); sometimes used for (殀)" --Karlgren.
In books 夭 yāo may still be found meaning 'flourishing, luxuriant', refering to vegetation. But the usual meaning is 'die young', which seems to be almost the opposite.
The word 夭 yāo 'die young' is cognate to 夭 yāo 'young'. An old form 殀 contains 歹 (dǎi) 'death', but now (among both simple and full form characters) it is simply written 夭, since the earlier meanings are now rare.
