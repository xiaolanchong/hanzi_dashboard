(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 夺:) The full form 奪 is 大 (dà) 'big' over 隹 (zhuī) 'bird' over 寸 (cùn) 'hand'. In the simple form 夺, 隹 is omitted. To seize a 大 big 隹 bird with your 寸 hand. The character 奞 (suí), composed of 大 over 隹, once meant 'spread the wings and fly'. Compare 奋(奮) fèn.
