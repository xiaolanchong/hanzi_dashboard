1051 奖(F獎) [jiǎng] prize, award; 奖金 bonus; 奖学金 scholarship
奖[獎] ²jiǎng {B} n. award; prize; reward ◆v. give a prize/award ◆b.f. encourage; praise; reward 奖励 jiǎnglì*
From (将將) jiāng phonetic over 犬 (quǎn) 'dog' or 大 (dà) 'big'.
The original meaning had something to do with dogs and discipline (嗾犬厲之); the original "prize" might have been a bone. The dot in 犬 is missing from the variant form 奬 and the simple form 奖.
