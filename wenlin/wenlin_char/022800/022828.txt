The oracle-bone character (from 王宏源) seems to show two hands holding a large U shape. Such a penannular jade ring was called a 玦 jué. In ancient times the jué symbolized authority, or cutting off a relationship. An archer's thumbring was also called a 玦 jué. The meaning 'break-through' might derive from the missing portion of the ring, where it is broken through; or from "the bursting loose of the bow string" as Karlgren says. The name of the hexagram ䷪ guài is just a slight variation of jué.
决 jué as in 决定 juédìng 'decide' is a cognate word.
