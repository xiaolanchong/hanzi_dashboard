1870 奈 [nài] 无可奈何 wúkěnàihé have no alternative
奈 ²nài {E} b.f. what; how? 耐烦 nàifán 无可奈何 wúkěnàihé
Don't confuse 奈 nài with 柰 nài or 夸 kuā.
奈 was originally just a variant of 柰 nài, a kind of apple. The character was borrowed for the abstract homophone nài as in wúkěnàihé, and now the form 奈 with 大 on top is used in 无可奈何 while the original 柰 with 木 (mù) 'tree' on top is still used for the apple.
