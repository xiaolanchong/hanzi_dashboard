431  夜 [yè] (夜晚 yèwǎn) night; 半夜, 午夜 midnight; 夜里 at night
夜 ¹yè {A} n. night; evening | ∼ shēn le. ∼深了。 The evening has gotten late.
A 亻(人 rén) person under a 亠 roof at 月 (yuè) night.
The true explanation is, 夜 comes from 亦 yì phonetic and 夕 (xī) 'night'. 夕 (depicting the moon) at the lower right side has taken on a unique shape in 夜, and 亦 has become 亠 plus 亻.
