==== 匱(S匮) [kuì] deficient  [guì] (old form of 櫃)
櫃/匱[柜/匮] ³guì {E} b.f. cupboard; cabinet 柜子 guìzi* 衣柜 yīguì*
匮[匱] ⁵kuì b.f. lack 匮乏 kuìfá 不匮 ²bùkuì
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 匮:) From 匚 (fāng) (picture of a cabinet), and 贵(貴) guì phonetic.
This was the old form of 柜(櫃) guì 'cabinet'. How it came to mean 'deficient' isn't clear (empty cabinet?).
