(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 务:) Originally 矛 (máo) 'spear', 攵(攴 pū) 'beat', and 力 (lì) 'strength', meaning to apply one's force. An old form 敄, without 力, survives in 婺瞀蝥鍪骛鹜.
攵 was reduced by one stroke to 夂, giving the modern full form 務. 矛 was deleted, giving the modern simple form 务.
