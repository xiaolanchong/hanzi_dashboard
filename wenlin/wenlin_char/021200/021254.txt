1403 匆 [cōng] 匆匆 cōngcōng, 匆忙 cōngmáng in a hurry
匆 ²cōng {E} b.f. urgent; rushed 匆匆 ¹cōngcōng*
The old form 悤 is 囱 cōng phonetic over 心 (xīn) 'heart'. A variant, 怱, is 匆 over 心; the shape 匆, now used instead of 悤, was originally simply a variant way of writing 囱. Now some simple form characters contain 匆 over 心: e.g. 葱偬; others have the older 悤: e.g. 骢璁.
Also compare 总(總) zǒng, 窗 chuāng.
