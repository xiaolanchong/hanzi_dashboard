Deep 氵(水 shuǐ) water, deep 穴 (xuě) hole, and deep 木 (mù) forest. 穴 is missing the dot on top. Really the right side 罙 was from 穴 pit,  hand and 火 (huǒ) fire. The  hand and 火 torch mutated into 木 mù.
The earlier form 罙 without 氵 is co-signific in 探 tàn ("put hand into deep pit"). See also 琛 chēn where 罙 is phonetic.
