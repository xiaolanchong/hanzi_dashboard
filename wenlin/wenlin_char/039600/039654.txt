2806 髦 [máo] 时髦 shímáo fashionable, stylish
髦 ⁵máo {E} b.f. long hair 牦牛 máoniú ◆char. 时髦 shímáo(r)*
From 髟 (biāo) 'hair' and 毛 máo 'hair'.
Etymologically the same word as 毛, meaning 'hair on the head'. Then it meant hair on a child's forehead. Now somehow the character 髦 has come to be used only in the word 时髦 shímáo 'stylish'.
