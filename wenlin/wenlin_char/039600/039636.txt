(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 体:) The full form 體 is 骨 (gǔ) 'bone' plus 豊 lǐ 'vessel'.
"Body; corporation; substance, the essential; (treat as essential:) treat with consideration; form, type -- is 豊 liei phonetic or co-signific (骨 bones and 豊 vessels)?" --Karlgren.
The simple form 体 is completely different. It is the 本 (běn) main part of a 亻(人 rén) person: the body. (According to Henshall, the form 体, standard in Japan, "...has been used for several centuries as a substitute, but is technically a separate character with an early meaning of crude...". Wieger lists 体 under phonetic series 147 as běn 'rude').
