From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 故 (gù) 'cause'.
"A 人 man and his 故 cause" --Karlgren.
Compare 作 zuò which also means 'do, make'. It seems that there used to be only one character, 作, with two slightly different pronunciations, but both meaning the same thing. Then "comparatively recently" a new character 做 was invented for one of the pronunciations. Ironically, the two pronunciations have become the same in Mandarin (though not in all dialects), but we have to deal with two characters. Use 作 for 'making' abstract things, 做 for 'making' concrete objects.
"两字用法的大致区别是: 抽象意义词语、书面语色彩较重的词语, 特别是成语, 多写成 '作', 如 '作罢' '作对' '作废' '作怪' '作乱' '作战' '装模作样' '认贼作父'; 后面是双音节动词时, 一般也用 '作', 如 '作调查' '作处理'。具体东西的制造写成 '做', 如 '做桌子' '做衣服'。" --现代汉语规范字典.
