(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 师:) The left side is 𠂤 (duī) 'wall' (reduced to two strokes in the simple form), and the right side may derive from 匝 (zā) 'circle' (not 市 shǐ 'market'). The original meaning was 'army':
"The garrison 匝 all around the 𠂤 wall of the city?" --Karlgren.
Army: military chief: master: teacher.
Compare 帅 shuài, which has one stroke less.
