帥[帅] ²shuài {D} b.f. commander in chief 元帅 yuánshuài ◆n. ①Surname ②chess piece corresponding to the king (usu. red, cf. jiàng 将) ◆s.v. handsome; chic | Tā zì xiě de hěn ∼. 他字写得很∼。 He writes a beautiful hand. ◆v. 〈wr.〉 command (army)
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 帅:) The left side is 𠂤 duī 'mound', abbreviated to two strokes in the simple form 帅. The right side is 巾 (jīn) 'cloth'.
The function of 𠂤 'mound' in 帥 'commander' is uncertain, says Karlgren. Wieger says "巾 is the guidon of the commander", that is, a small flag for leading troops in battle.
Etymologically the same word as 率 shuài 'command'.
Compare 师(師) shī, which has one more stroke than 帅(帥).
