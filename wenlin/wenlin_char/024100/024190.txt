(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 几:) 几 is a picture of a small table, which is the original meaning of the word jī (as in 茶几 chájī 'tea table').
Sixteenth of the 214 radicals.
The word jǐ 'how many; a few' among full form characters is written 幾, composed of 幺 (yāo) 'small' (doubled), and 戍 (shù) 'frontier guard'. (Frontier guards "are attentive to the least movement, to the smallest event" --Wieger.)
Among simple form characters, 幾 is replaced by 几.
