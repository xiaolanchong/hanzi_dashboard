1586 帳(S帐) [zhàng] curtain (蚊帳 mosquito net); account
帳[帐] ²zhàng {E} b.f. ①curtain; canopy 蚊帐 wénzhàng ②tent 帐篷 zhàngpeng*
账/帐[賬/帳] ¹zhàng {C} n. ①accounts; account book 帐本 zhàngběn(r)* 账籍 zhàngjí 结帐 jiézhàng* ②debt; credit; credit account
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 帐:) From 巾 (jīn) 'cloth' and 长(長) cháng phonetic.
"Awning, tent, curtain, screen, veil; sheet, scroll, bill, account; calculate, to plan" --Karlgren(1923).
Karlgren says this is the "correct" character for the meaning 'account', and that the other character 账(賬) (with 贝貝 bèi 'money') is "vulgar"; but modern usage is divided. It's still not clear what is standard. Of course, for the non-financial meanings (curtain/net/tent), only 帐(帳) should be used.
