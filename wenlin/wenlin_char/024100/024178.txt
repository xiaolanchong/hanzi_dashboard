"Tree-stem used as battering ram or pestle" --Karlgren(1923).
"It represents a pestle. Compare 午. By extension, to grind, to destroy; morally, to oppose, to offend against; blunt arms, offence, injury, etc." --Wieger.
Etymologically the same word as 杆 gān and 竿 gān.
Gān 'dry' is written 乾 in the full form. (Among simple form characters 乾 is used only for ☰ qián.)
The full form of 干(幹) gàn 'do' is from 𠦝 and 人 over 干. 幹 gàn 'do' seems to be cognate with 干 gān 'tree-stem'; it also occurs in the word 树干(樹幹) shùgàn 'tree trunk':
"Trunk of a tree; (wood material, manufacture:) to work, make, do, manage; work, occupation; ability" --Karlgren(1923).
