(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 帮:) The full form 幫 is 封 fēng phonetic over 帛 (bó) 'silks'. The simple form 帮 is 邦 bāng phonetic over 巾 (jīn) 'cloth'. Karlgren (1923) describes the simple form 帮 as a "vulgar" character.
The primary meaning is the upper part of a shoe: 鞋帮 xiébāng, which might be made of silk cloth.
