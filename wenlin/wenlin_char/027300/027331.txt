1875 櫃(S柜) [guì] (櫃子) cabinet; 櫃臺 counter; 掌櫃 shopkeeper
櫃/匱[柜/匮] ³guì {E} b.f. cupboard; cabinet 柜子 guìzi* 衣柜 yīguì*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 柜:) Originally written 匱, from 匚 (fāng) (picture of a cabinet), and 貴 guì phonetic. 木 (mù) 'wood' was added, producing the full form 櫃.
In the simple form 柜, 匱 has been replaced by 巨 (jù). (Actually the character 柜 existed previously as an old form of 榉 jǔ.)
