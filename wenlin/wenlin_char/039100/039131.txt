Nobody agrees on the stroke order of the full form 飛; I consulted four sources and found four different stroke orders. The one I chose to follow is that given in William McNaughton's "Reading and Writing Chinese".
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 飞:) "It represents a crane (very common in China) seen from behind. Upwards, the head and the neck bent up, as when the cranes are flying. Below, the tail. On both sides, the wings fluttering. The small strokes represent the quills separated when the bird is flying" --Wieger.
Compare 卂 (迅, 讯 xùn) which is the same bird without "quills".
