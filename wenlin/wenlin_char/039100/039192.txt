(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 余:) The character 余 yú formerly meant 'I, we':
"我也。自称发声之词。Composition: 从八 to distinguish; 从舍 contracted, 口 being replaced by 八. The Chinese custom required that anyone entering a 舍 house, 八 should make known his presence and distinguish himself from any other person by crying out: It is I, so and so, who comes for such and such a purpose..." --Wieger.
余 yú 'I' was also written 予 yú. But that old pronoun (along with 吾 wú) has been completely replaced by 我 wǒ in the modern language.
Since the character 余 is obsolete in its original meaning, it was possible to recycle it by using it as the simple form of 餘 'left-over'. In fact there are two simple forms corresponding to 餘: the common one is 余 yú 'left-over', and the other is 馀 Yú, a surname. In 馀, 食 (shí) 'food' has been simplified to 饣 as usual, whereas in 余 it has been discarded.
余 is phonetic in various characters pronounced quite differently in modern Mandarin. In 茶 chá 'tea', one of the horizontal strokes was lost.
