1162 餐 [cān] meal  [sūn]

The bottom is 食 (shí) 'food'.
The top, 歺又, is an obsolete character employed in 餐 as a phonetic. The upper left part, 歺, composed of 卜 over 夕, is just a variant of 歹 dǎi 'broken bone'. The upper right is 又 yòu 'hand'. A 又 hand holding a 歹 broken bone seems appropriate for carnivorous meals. Now 歺 is often used as an unauthorized simplified form of 餐, one sees it especially on street signs in the word 歺厅(餐厅) cāntīng 'dining hall'.
