==== 飠(S饣) [shí] (component, variant of 食)
No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
(Note: Wenlin 1.0 and 2.x do not use U+98e0 飠 because it appeared to be identical with 食 but half-width, while as a component it should have one stroke less. Changing policy April, 1999 to use U+98e0 instead of the user-defined code U+ef73 for this component.)
