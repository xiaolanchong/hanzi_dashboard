"It represents a crane (very common in China) seen from behind. Upwards, the head and the neck bent up, as when the cranes are flying. Below, the tail. On both sides, the wings fluttering. The small strokes represent the quills separated when the bird is flying" --Wieger.
Compare 卂 (迅, 讯 xùn) which is the same bird without "quills".
