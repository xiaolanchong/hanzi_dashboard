(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 斋:) The full form 齋 is 齊 qí phonetic over 示 (shì) 'prognostic'.
"Abstinence; from 示 and 齊. In this character, the two horizontal strokes of 齊 are mingled together with those of 示. The meaning is, 齊 to rule one's self, so that one may be fit to receive the 示 warnings of heaven" --Wieger.
"Purification, abstinence, fasting; pure; retired apartment; studio, library" --Karlgren.
The simple form 斋 is 文 (wén) over 而 (ér).
