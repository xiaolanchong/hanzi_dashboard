==== 鼗(F鞀) [táo] hand-drum used by peddlars
No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
From 兆 zhào phonetic over 鼓 (gǔ) 'drum'.
Also written 鞉 or 鞀. Strangely enough, we call 鼗 the "simple" form and 鞀 the "full" form, only because 鼗 is in the simple-form GB standard and 鞀 is in the full-form Big5 standard. This is one of those absurd situations where the "simple" form has more strokes than the "full" form!
