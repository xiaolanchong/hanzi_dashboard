==== 鼴(S鼹) [yǎn] mole
鼴[鼹] ¹²yǎn b.f. mole 鼹鼩 yǎnqú 针鼹 ²zhēnyǎn
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 鼹:) From 鼠 (shǔ) 'mouse' and 晏 yàn or 匽 yǎn phonetic.
Strangely enough, we call 鼹 the "simple" form and 鼴 the "full" form, only because 鼹 is in the simple-form GB standard and 鼴 is in the full-form Big5 standard. This is one of those absurd situations where the "simple" form has more strokes than the "full" form!
