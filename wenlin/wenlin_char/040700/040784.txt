"A whole, regular and perfect harmony. The idea comes from the even height of ears in a cornfield; 禾麦吐穗, 上平也。象形。There is, in this character, an intention of representing the perspective. The lower stroke 一, says the Glose (说文), represents the foreground; the upper stroke 一 represents the background. The ears are ascending when going towards the background. Three ears represent a multitude." --Wieger.
