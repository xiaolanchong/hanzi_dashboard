The full form 勢 is 埶 (yì) 'agriculture' over 力 (lì) 'strength'.
"Strength, power; authority, influence; inherent value; conditions, circumstances -- the 力 strength applied in 埶 agriculture, in a profession" --Karlgren.
In the simple form 势, 坴 is replaced by 扌, so that the top becomes 执 zhí 'to hold in the hand'. Compare 热(熱) rè 'hot', in which the same simplification has been made.
