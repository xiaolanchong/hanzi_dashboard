2434 揀(S拣) [jiǎn] choose, select, pick out
揀[拣] ¹jiǎn {B} v. ①select; pick out ②pick up; collect; gather
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 拣:) From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 柬 jiǎn (simplified ).
拣(揀) is etymologically the same word as 柬 jiǎn, "To 八 divide a 束 bundle: choose; etymologically same word as 簡" --Karlgren(1923).
Compare 捡(撿) jiǎn, which also means 'pick up'; the two words 拣 and 捡 are pronounced identically in modern Mandarin, but not in Cantonese; they do not seem to be etymologically related.
