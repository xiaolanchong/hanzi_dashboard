1285 插 [chā] insert, stick in; 插头 plug  [zhǎ]
插 ¹chā {B} v. insert; interpose | Bǎ zhège duạ̌nyǔ ∼ zài liǎng ge jùzi zhījiān. 把这个短语∼在两个句子之间。 Insert this phrase between the two sentences.
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 臿 chá phonetic.
臿 chá is an obsolete character meaning 'to hull grain'; it is composed of 千, depicting a pestle, and 臼 (jiù) 'mortar'. This makes a nice picture for the meaning of 插 chā 'insert'.
