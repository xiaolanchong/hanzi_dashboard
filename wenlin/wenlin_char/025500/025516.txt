---- 掬 [jū] hold with both hands
掬 ⁶jū {E} v. hold with both hands
From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand', 勹 (bāo) 'wrap' and 米 (mǐ) 'rice'.
"As much 米 rice as you can 勹 'enclose', clasp -- a handful... enlarged by 手" --Karlgren.
The original form 匊 (without 扌) is a phonetic component in 菊 jú 'chrysanthemum' and 鞠 jū 'bow'.
