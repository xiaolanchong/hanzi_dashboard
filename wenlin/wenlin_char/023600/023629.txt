(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 尸:) "Corpse, body; sit as representative of the dead at sacrifices; superintend --- picture of a sitting or lying man" --Karlgren(1923).
"A seated man. The living person who anciently represented the dead; by extension, a dead person." --Wieger.
The full form 屍 has 死 (sǐ) 'death' added to it (but the radical is always 尸).
