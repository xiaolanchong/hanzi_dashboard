The simple form 尽 is drastically abbreviated. The top of 盡 contains a derivative of 聿 (yù), now obsolete, which is also phonetic in 津 jīn. The four dots 灬 are 火 huǒ 'fire', and the bottom is 皿 mǐn 'bowl', or in this case, a brazier in which the fire burns. The primitive meaning was 'ashes', which is now written 烬(燼) jìn, with the addition of another 火.
"By extension, ended, finished (the ashes being the final result of the combustion), an action that went to its term, consummation, exhaustion" --Wieger.
Two full forms 盡 jìn and 儘 jǐn are distinguished, 儘 with the addition of 亻(人 rén) being used when the pronounciation is jǐn. Jìn and jǐn are cognate words. There is only one simple form 尽.
