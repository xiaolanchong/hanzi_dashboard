(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 属:) 尸 (shī) here stands for 尾 (wěi) 'tail': Tail --> appendage --> belong to. The full form 屬 contains 蜀 shǔ ('silkworm') phonetic, where the simple form 属 has 禹 yǔ.
Both Wieger (page 696, middle) and Karlgren list the simple form character 属 as a variant of 屬.
