The analysis is uncertain, but 凡 may be an abstract symbol, with the 丶 dot (originally 一) representing unity, and 几 surrounding it suggesting the idea of "containing everything".
Another theory is that 凡 depicted a sail, which is now written 帆 fān (Lindqvist cites Joseph Needham as a source for this theory).
