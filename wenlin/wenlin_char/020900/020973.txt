1255 凭(F憑) [píng] lean on; based on; no matter ( = 不论)
凭[憑] ²píng {C} v. lean on/against ◆b.f. evidence; proof; testimony 凭据 ¹píngjù* ◆cov. based on; according to | ∼ liángxīn shuō ∼良心说 in all fairness ◆conj. no matter (what/how/etc.) | ∼ nǐ shì shuí dōu bùxíng! ∼你是谁都不行! It won't do, no matter who you are.
The full form 憑 is 馮 píng phonetic over 心 (xīn) 'heart'. The simple form 凭 is 任 (rèn) 'no matter' over 几 (jī) 'table' (a table is something you can lean on; possibly 'chair' is a better translation).
凭 and 憑 are both old characters. 说文 (100 A.D.) contains 凭 but not 憑. A variant form 凴 is 馮 over 几.
