478  况(F況) [kuàng] 情况 circumstances; 况且 moreover
况[況] ⁵kuàng {E} b.f. ①circumstances 情况 qíngkuàng* ②furthermore 况且 kuàngqiě*
From 冫(二 èr) 'two' and 兄 xiōng phonetic.
In this case 冫 does not mean 'water' or 'ice', it is from 二 'two': secondly; moreover.
The character 況, in which the left side is 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water', was originally a different (obsolete) word 況 huàng 'ice water', but now 況 is used in place of 况 among full form characters.
