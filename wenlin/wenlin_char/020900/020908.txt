The bottom is 冫(冰 bīng) 'ice'. The top 夂 was a pair of legs with the heels (the ends) indicated, or a rope with knots at both ends. Originally 终 zhōng 'end' and dōng 'winter' (the end of the year) were both written the same way. 冬 'winter' was then clarified by adding 冫 'ice' (a variant had 日 (rì) 'sun' instead).
The top 夂 came to be written like a foot pointing downward, stepping on the ice. 夂 is said to mean 'walk slowly'. In the 冬 winter, you must 夂 walk slowly to avoid slipping on the 冫 ice. Compare 夏 xià 'summer', in which you 夂 walk slowly because it's hot.
