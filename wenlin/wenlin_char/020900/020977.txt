1659 凱(S凯) [kǎi] 凱歌 kǎigē song of triumph
凱[凯] ³kǎi {E} b.f. victorious in battle 凯歌 kǎigē* 凯旋 kǎixuán
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 凯:) From 岂(豈) qǐ and 几 (jī) 'table'.
The basic meaning is 'triumphant strains', as in 凯歌 kǎigē 'song of triumph'. This may have been the original meaning of 岂(豈) qǐ, which depicted a drum.
