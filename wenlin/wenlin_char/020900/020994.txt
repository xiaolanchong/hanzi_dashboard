==== 刂 [dāo] (radical 18, component: same as 刀 (dāo) 'knife'; 侧刀旁 cèdāopáng)
No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
Usually occurs as a right side component, as in 到制利别 etc.
18th of the 214 radicals.
In the characters 辨班归帅, where two vertical strokes occur in the middle or on the left side, the second stroke is  rather than 亅 (curved rather than hooked). Both 归 and 帅 are etymologically unrelated to 刀; the two strokes are simplified from 𠂤. Similarly, the first two strokes of 坚紧贤竖 etc. are simplified from 臣; they are vertical strokes without any curve or hook.
