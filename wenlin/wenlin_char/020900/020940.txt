From 冫(冰 bīng) 'ice' and 夌 líng phonetic.
The primitive meaning was 'ice'. The meaning extended to 'ice-cold'; 'cruel'; 'oppress'; 'insult'; 'encroach'; 'approach'; the most common modern usage is in the compound 凌晨 língchén 'approaching daybreak', where it has lost any negative connotation. Of course it usually is cold just before dawn.
Compare 棱菱陵绫鲮, all pronounced líng.
