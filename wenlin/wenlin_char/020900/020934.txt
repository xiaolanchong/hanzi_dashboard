Originally 准(準) zhǔn meant 'water level'. The full form 準 is composed of 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 隼 sǔn ('falcon') phonetic.
“A water-level; to level, equalize, fix; equal, certain, fixed; certainly; allow; often abbreviated into 准” --Karlgren(1923).
The simple form 准 is 冫 (two-dot water) plus 隹. Among simple form characters 準 is not used.
Among full form characters, originally only 準 was used, but a distinction has sometimes been made between 准 and 準. 准 is used for 'allow; grant; permit', as in 准許, 准予, 批准 etc.; for 'according to', as in 准此. Also in 准將 and 准尉. 準 is used for all other meanings. However, actual usage, even as prescribed by authorities, is a mess: both 准 and 準 are used for 'quasi-', as in 准平原.
A variant form is 凖.
