冲 is composed of 冫(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 中 zhōng phonetic.
The form 沖, with 氵 three-dot water instead of 冫 two-dot water, is more common among full form characters. But 冲 with two dots is very old, it occurs in 老子 Lǎozǐ.
Another character 衝 is used among full form characters for chòng 'towards' and sometimes for chōng 'rush' when the meaning doesn't involve water. 衝 is composed of 行 (xíng) 'walk' and 重 zhòng phonetic.
冲(衝) chòng (fourth tone) also means 'mechanical punch'. Otherwise, in multisyllabic words 冲 is always pronounced chōng (first tone).
Summary: there are two full forms, 沖 and 衝 (sometimes interchangeable); there is only one simple form: 冲.
