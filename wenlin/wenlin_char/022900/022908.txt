==== 奼(S姹) [chà] (書) beautiful
奼[姹] ⁷chà {E} b.f. beautiful (flower) 姹紫嫣红 chàzǐyānhóng
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 姹:) From 女 (nǚ) 'woman' and 宅 zhái or 乇 tuō phonetic.
This is one of those absurd cases where the "simple" form (姹) is more complex than the "full" form (奼). We designate them this way because only 姹 is included in the GB standard (for 简体字) and only 奼 is included in the Big5 standard (for 繁体字).
