73   她 [tā] she, her  [jiě] [chí]
她 ²tā {A} pr. she (neologism for ¹tā)
From 女 (nǚ) 'woman' and 也 (yě 'also'). The character 她 used to be a variant of 姐 jiě 'sister'. In modern times 她 was borrowed as a substitute for 他 tā 'he, she, it', for the specific meaning 'she'. The modern use of three characters for 她 tā 'she', 他 tā 'he', and 它 tā 'it' has no counterpart in the spoken language, where there is only one word tā. For this reason, when Chinese speakers learn English, they often forget to differentiate between 'he' and 'she'. (In some fántǐzì writings, two additional characters are used for the word tā: 牠, for animals, and 祂, for God.)
