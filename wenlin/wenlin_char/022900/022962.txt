From 女 (nǚ) 'woman' and 旦 dān phonetic.
"Concubine of Chou hsin, the last ruler of the Shang dynasty" --Mathews.
Supposedly 妲 Dá was her courtesy name (字) and 己 Jǐ was her family name (姓), yet the order is Dá Jǐ; maybe this was customary in the Shang dynasty (which is very old, almost pre-historic)?
