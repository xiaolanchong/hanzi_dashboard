==== 耥 [tāng] weed and loosen soil; to rake; 耥耙 tāngbà paddy-field harrow  [tǎng]
耥 ³tāng v. weed and loosen the soil
From 耒 (lěi) 'plow' and 尚 shàng phonetic.
Many dictionaries have the pronunciation tǎng (3rd tone), but we follow 现代汉语词典(1996) which has tāng. This may be the same word as 蹚 when it has the meaning 'weed and loosen soil'.
