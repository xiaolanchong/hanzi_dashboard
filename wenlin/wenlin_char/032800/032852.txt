From 耳 (ěr) 'ear' and 关(𢇇). The similarity to 关(𢇇關) guān is accidental.
"The seal has 絲 to the right, corrupted in the modern form: to string together 耳 the ears of slain enemies." --Karlgren.
How gruesome! Let us say, you get in touch with people by way of their 耳 ears. You can remember 联 contains 关 by associating 关系 guānxi 'relation, significance' with 联系 liánxì 'contact, relation'. Don't confuse 联 with 连 lián 'link, in a row, even', which is similar in meaning.
