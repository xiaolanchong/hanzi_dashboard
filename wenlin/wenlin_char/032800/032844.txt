Originally 戠, from 音 (yīn) 'sound' and 戈 (gē) 'weapon', the meaning was 'officer':
"The man with 戈 a lance who 音 commands" --Karlgren.
To 戠 was added 耳 (ěr) 'ear', since one who governs should also know how to listen. Extended meaning: office, profession, occupation.
In the simple form 职, 戠 is replace by 只 zhǐ phonetic. In fact most of the simple form characters with 只 as phonetic originally contained 戠.
