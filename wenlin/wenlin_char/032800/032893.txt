(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 听:) The full form 聽 is composed of 耳 (ěr) 'ear', 㥁(德 dé) 'virtue', and 壬 tǐng phonetic (lower left corner).
The simple form 听 is 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' plus 斤 jīn phonetic. (听 long ago stood for a word yǐn 'smile'; it was already being used instead of 聽 tīng by the 17th century).
