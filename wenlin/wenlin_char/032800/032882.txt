(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 声:) Picture of a musical instrument, chimes made of stone, hanging from a frame. The full form 聲, has on the right of 声, 殳 (shū) 'beat' (a hand holding a mallet), and below, 耳 (ěr) 'ear'. These stone-age chimes are called 磬 qìng.
The use of 声 instead of 聲 dates back at least 800 years.
