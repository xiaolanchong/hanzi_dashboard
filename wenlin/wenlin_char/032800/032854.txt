(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 圣:) The full form 聖 is composed of 耳 (ěr) 'ear' and 呈 chéng phonetic.
"Those who 耳 listened to and understood the 呈 advices given, and therefore became wise; wise, perfect; 通也。从耳, 从呈。按耳順之谓聖" --Wieger.
The simple form 圣 is identical to an obsolete ancient character, which was phonetic in 怪 guài. The use of 圣 as an abbreviation for 聖 was mentioned by Karlgren(1923).
