---- 饑 [jī] (variant of 饥飢 jī 'starve')  [qí]
饥[飢/饑] ⁶jī {E} b.f. ①hungry; starving 饥饿 ¹jī'è* ②famine 饥荒 jīhuang
From 飠(食 shí) 'eat' and 幾 jǐ phonetic. 饑 appears to be slightly less standard than 飢 among full form characters. At any rate, the 几 in 飢 is not the result of simplification from 幾; 饑 and 飢 are variants of independent origin. The simple form is always 饥.
