薦[荐] ¹¹jiàn {E} b.f. ①recommend 推荐 ¹tuījiàn ②〈wr.〉 grass; straw ③straw mat 草荐 cǎojiàn*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 荐:) "Grass fodder, pasturage; straw, straw packing, envelopped object, a present; give a present, oblation, sacrifice; recommend, introduce" --Karlgren.
The full form 薦 is composed of 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' over 廌 (zhì) 'beast' (the beast eats the grass). The simple form 荐 has 存 cún instead of 廌.
