(The glyphs in the Unicode 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 books all have 産, not 產.)
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 萨:) There once was a character composed of 艹(草 cǎo) 'plant' over 產 chǎn phonetic, which was the name of a kind of flute (according to Karlgren). That character was phonetic in 萨(薩) Sà, a proper name, the signific part being 阝(阜 fù) 'hill'.
Aside from being a surname, 萨 is used for transcribing foreign words such as 菩萨 púsà 'bodhisattva', 萨尔瓦多 Sà'ěrwǎduō El Salvador.
