(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 药:) The top is 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass'. The bottom of the full form 藥 is 樂 yuè phonetic. The bottom of the simple form 药 is 约 yuē phonetic. 药 really originated in 葯 yào 'Dahurian angelica', the name of a particular herb. 葯 yào was borrowed to be a variant of 藥 yào, the pronunciations being the same.
