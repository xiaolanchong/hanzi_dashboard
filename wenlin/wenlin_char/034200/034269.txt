(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 艺:) "Agriculture, cultivate, art, profession; skill, cunning, rule, law; limit" --Karlgren.
Originally 埶, from 坴 a 圥 plant on the 土 ground, and 丸 =  a hand planting it. To 埶 was added 艹 grass and 云 a cloud to water the crop, producing 藝 which is the full form. The simple form 艺 is just 艹 grass over 乙 yǐ phonetic.
埶 also occurs in 热(熱) rè and 势(勢) shì.
