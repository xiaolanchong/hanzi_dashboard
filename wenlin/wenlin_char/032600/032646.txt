==== 羆(S罴) [pí] a kind of bear
羆[罴] ⁹pí n. brown bear
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 罴:) From 罢(罷 bà) phonetic and 熊 (xióng) 'bear' (abbreviated to 灬).
In the full form 羆, the top 罷 or the bottom 熊 is abbreviated so that 能 is not doubled. The simple form 罴 doesn't have 能 at all, since 罷 is simplified to 罢.
