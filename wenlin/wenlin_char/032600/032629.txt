(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 骂:) The bottom is 马(馬) mǎ phonetic.
The top of 罵 is 罒, originally 网 (wǎng) 'net'.
The forms 駡 and 骂 have 吅, which is 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' doubled.
The meaning is to reprimand (with the 口 mouth!) someone caught (with a 网 net!) for some offence (compare 罚 fá 'punish', and the old word 詈 lì 'curse').
