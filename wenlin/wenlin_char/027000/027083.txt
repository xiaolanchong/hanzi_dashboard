(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 构:) The form 冓 seems to have originally depicted a pair of fish, face to face, meaning 'to meet' (now 遘 gòu).
It came to be written 冓, like 井 over 再. 媾 gòu 'wedding, coitus' was the same word (people interlocking), the same character being enlarged by 女. 木 (mù) 'wood' was added for the meaning 'structure'. 沟 gōu 'ditches' and 篝 gōu 'bamboo frame' are cognate words.
The simple form 构 replaces the right side with 勾 gòu. Don't confuse it with 枸 jǔ, gǒu.
