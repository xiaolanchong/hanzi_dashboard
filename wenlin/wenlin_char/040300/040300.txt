2347 鵬(S鹏) [péng] fabulous (mythical) giant bird  [fèng]
鵬[鹏] ⁷péng n. roc
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 鹏:) From 朋 péng ('friend') phonetic and 鸟(鳥 niǎo) 'bird'.
It was once believed that 朋 depicted the bird's enormous wings, and that 鸟 was added when 朋 was borrowed for the meaning 'friend'. But recent archeological evidence does not support that theory.
