133  等 [děng] equal; class; wait; et cetera (etc.)
等 ¹děng* {A} v. wait | Qị̌ng ∼ yī̠huǐr. 请∼一会儿。 Please wait a minute. ◆b.f. ①class; grade 头等 tóuděng* ②be equal 平等 píngděng ③〈lg.〉 division ◆suf. and so on
From 竹 (zhú) 'bamboo' and 寺 sì 'temple'.
竹 probably stands for 竹简 zhújiǎn, the bamboo strips which were used for writing on before the invention of paper. Hence, record keeping, order, classification; (belonging to the same class:) equal.
寺 sì 'temple' is part of 等 děng due to an etymological accident. An ancient word sounded similar to 寺 sì, so it was written 等, with 竹 signific and 寺 phonetic. That word disappeared, and the character 等 was borrowed to represent a synonym, now pronounced děng.
The meaning of 等 děng has been extended from "class, rank" to "await one's turn, according to rank" (--Karlgren).
