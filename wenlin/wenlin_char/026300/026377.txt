有 yǒu is composed of 𠂇 yòu phonetic and 月 (yuè) 'moon'.
𠂇 was originally , a picture of a right hand; see the modern characters 又 yòu and 右 yòu. The character  by itself was originally used for yǒu 'to have' (to hold in the hand). Later 月 was added; some scholars believe it was 肉 (ròu) 'meat' rather than 月 (yuè) 'moon'.
To have 肉 meat in your 又 hand; or, to have the 月 moon in your 又 hand: the ultimate possession.
Compare 右 yòu 'right', 左 zuǒ 'left' and 友 yǒu 'friend'.
