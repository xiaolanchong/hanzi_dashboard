Composed of 亡 wáng phonetic, 月 (yuè) 'moon' and 王 (wáng 'king').
"Moon facing the sun, full moon; to face, gaze to a distance, look out for, long for, expect, hope -- 月 moon is signific and 亡 phonetic; below, the seal has 壬 (interpretation uncertain), not 王" --Karlgren.
The bottom 壬 tǐng (now 王) depicted a person standing on the 土 (tǔ) earth, which is a suitable vantage point for moon-gazing. (You could think of 王 wáng and 亡 wáng as both being phonetic).
