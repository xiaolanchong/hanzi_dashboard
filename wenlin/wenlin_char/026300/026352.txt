1619 曰 [yuē] say
曰 ²yuē {D} v. 〈wr.〉 ①say; speak ②call; name
A 口 (kǒu) mouth, with a 一 line representing words coming out of it. Used in classical Chinese for 'say' (like modern 说 shuō), especially in the expression: “孔子曰... Confucius said...”.
曰 yuē is not the same as 日 rì 'sun'. The two characters are easily confused since the only reliable difference is that 曰 yuē should be wider. Sometimes the middle horizontal stroke is written differently, extending all the way to the right side in 日 rì but falling slightly short in 曰 yuē; however, this convention is only occasionally observed.
Please note: in this database, characters that appear to contain 曰 or 日 as a component are generally listed only under 日 rì, not under 曰 yuē. The exceptions to this rule are characters that are historically related to 曰 yuē, which are listed under both 曰 and 日.
