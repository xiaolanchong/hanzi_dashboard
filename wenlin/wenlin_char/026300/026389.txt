---- 朕 [zhèn] (书) I, we (used only by the emperor)
朕 ⁷zhèn pr. 〈wr./hist.〉 I (used by an emperor)
The left side 月 was 舟 a boat, and the right side 关 was  two hands with a 火 flame (same as in 送 sòng). Whatever this character meant makes little difference since it was usurped by the emperor for his personal pronoun.
Phonetic in 腾藤滕 téng and in 胜(勝) shèng (full form).
