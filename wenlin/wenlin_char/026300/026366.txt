454  曾 [céng] (曾经 céngjīng) in the past  [zēng] great- (grandmother)
曾 ²céng {B} adv. once; ever (in the past); before | ²Tā ∼ zuòguo yǎnyuán. 她∼做过演员。 She was once an actress.
曾 ³zēng {E} b.f. separated by two generations; great-(grandfather, grandchild, etc.) 曾祖父 zēngzǔfù 曾孙 zēngsūn* ◆n. Surname
曾 is like 會(会) huì 'meet', with 丷(八 bā) at the top instead of . Supposing that 會 depicts a rice-cooking pot with a  lid, as some modern scholars believe, then 曾 might be the pot with the lid removed. This could imply that the rice has been eaten 'in the past'. It is time to add some more rice, hence 'increase'.
The pronunciation is 曾 zēng only as a surname and as a prefix 'great-', as in 曾孙 zēngsūn 'great-grandson'. It is etymologically the same word as 增 as in 增加 zēngjiā 'increase'.
