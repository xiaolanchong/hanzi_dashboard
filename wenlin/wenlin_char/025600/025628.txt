From 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' and 叟 sǒu ('old man').
Originally written 叜, from 宀 'roof', 火 'fire', and 又 'hand'. Searching a house, holding a torch in the hand.
The character became altered to 叟 and was borrowed for the word sǒu 'old man', and 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' was added for the original meaning 搜 sōu 'search'.
