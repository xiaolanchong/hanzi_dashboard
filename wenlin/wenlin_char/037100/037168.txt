(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 邻:) From 令 lìng phonetic and 阝(邑 yì) 'city'.
In the full form 鄰 the left side is 粦 lín phonetic (米 over 舛).
Compare 临 lín which is similar in meaning but apparantly unrelated etymologically. (The ancient pronunciations were 邻 *lien and 临 *pliem, approximately.)
