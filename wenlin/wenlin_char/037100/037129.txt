(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 乡:) The full form 鄉 originally depicted two people 乡 and 阝, sitting down at  a meal (part of 食 shí). The simple form 乡 is just the left hand side.
Compare 即 jí 'immediately' (one person facing food), and 既 jì 'already' (person facing away from food).
卿 qīng 'minister' was originally the same word and the same character as 乡(鄉) xiāng 'village'.
