1168 梦(F夢) [mèng] dream
梦[夢] ¹mèng {B} n. dream ◆b.f. to dream 梦见 mèngjian
The bottom is 夕 (xī) 'night'. The simple form 梦 has 林 lín 'forest' on top. Though one can 梦 dream about 林 forests, 梦 was perhaps an arbitrary abbreviation of the full form 夢, the top of which is from 苜 miè 'squint, bad sight', with 罒(目 mù) 'eye', and 冖 (mì) 'cover', indicating that the eyes are covered. Etymologically related to 蒙 méng 'cover', and 瞢 méng 'covered eyes, blindness'.
Compare 岁(歲) suì.
