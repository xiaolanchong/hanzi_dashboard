1961 廟(S庙) [miào] temple
廟[庙] ¹miào {B} n. ①temple; shrine ②temple fair
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 庙:) The full form 廟 is 朝 cháo 'morning' under 广 (guǎng) a roof:
"The 广 house for 朝 the morning rites" --Karlgren(1923).
An archaic form is 庿, with 苗 miáo phonetic.
The simple form is 庙, with 由 (yóu) instead of 苗 or 朝.
