(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 厂:) 厂 (two strokes) was an ancient character (now obsolete): hǎn 'cliff':
"A cliff which projects, a stiff slope" --Wieger.
厂 is the 27th of the 214 radicals. As a component, its meaning is often the same as 广: roof, shed.
"For a long time, cliff and dwelling were one and the same thing" --Lindqvist.
In modern Chinese, 厂 is the simplified form of chǎng 'factory', whose full form 廠 is 广 'roof' plus 敞 chǎng ('spacious') phonetic. A variant form is 厰.
Compare 广(廣) guǎng.
