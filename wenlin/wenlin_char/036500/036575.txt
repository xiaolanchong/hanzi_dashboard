(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 软:) Originally 耎, from 而 (ér) over 大 (dà): 大 large 而 beard; pliant, soft. Wieger gives the translation "muffled wheels, soft" (page 788), which might explain why 车(車 chē) 'car' was added, making 輭. The right side 耎 has been abbreviated to 欠 (qiàn) in both the full form 軟 and the simple form 软.
