網[网] ²wǎng {C} n./v. net
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 网:) Picture of a net.
The full form 網 is 糸 (sī) 'thread' plus 罔. In fact 罔 is from 亡 wáng phonetic plus 网 (distorted). The simple form 网 is close to the original, while the full form 網 contains extra parts 糸 and 亡 which attached themselves over the ages.
As a component, 网 is written 罒 in 罪 (zuì) 'crime', 罚 (fá) 'punish', etc.
