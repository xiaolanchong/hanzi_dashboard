陸[陆] ⁵lù {D} b.f. land 陆地 ¹lùdì* ◆n. Surname
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 陆:) Originally written 坴, from 圥 lù phonetic over 土 (tǔ) 'earth'. Later 阝(阜 fù) 'hill' was added. In the simple form, 坴 was reduced to 击. The element 坴 also occurs in 睦 mù 'friendly'; don't confuse 陸 with 陵 líng.
陆(陸) is sometimes used for 六 liù 'six' in financial documents to discourage alteration.
