From  (jiān) 'distress' and 隹 (zhuī) 'bird'. Cognate with 叹(嘆) tàn 'sigh'.  is the old form of 艰(艱) jiān 'difficult'. The role of 隹 'bird' is obscure, says Karlgren(1940). Wieger relates 難 to 暵 hàn 'parched':
"The state in which are the 隹 birds, when the earth is  dried and barren; famine, misery, difficulty of living" --Wieger.
In the simple form 难,  is abbreviated to 又 (yòu) 'hand': A 隹 bird in the 又 hand -- difficult, and a disaster for the bird.
