The character 隶 was originally used for the word dài 'catch', which is now written 逮 dài (as in 逮捕 dàibǔ 'arrest').
The word lì 'slave' is written 隸 in the full form; the right side is 隶, the left side is 柰 (nài) ("interpetation uncertain" --Karlgren).
隶 is now used as the simple form for lì 'slave'.
