陪 ¹péi* {B} v. ①accompany; keep sb. company | Nǐ néng ∼ tā huíjiā ma? 你能∼她回家吗? Can you see her home? ②assist ③compensate
From 阝(阜 fù) 'hill' and 咅 pǒu phonetic.
"To wall up, strengthen; assist, bear company... etymologically the same word as 培 péi" --Karlgren.
Don't confuse 陪 péi with 部 bù 'part', which has 阝(邑 yì) 'city' on the right side.
