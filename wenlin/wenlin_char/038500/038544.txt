1132 隐(F隱) [yǐn] hidden; 隐约 yǐnyuē faint, indistinct
隐[隱] ³yǐn {E} b.f. ①conceal; hide 隐藏 yǐncáng ②live as a recluse 隐居 yǐnjū* ③latent; dormant 隐患 yǐnhuàn ④hidden; secret 隐情 ²yǐnqíng ⑤painful
From 阝(阜 fù) 'hill'. In the simple form 隐 the right side is 急 jí 'urgent'. In the full form 隱 the right side is 爫 over 工 over 彐 over 心 (xīn) 'heart'. An obsolete character made of 爫 two hands and 工 (gōng) 'work', pronounced yǐn, was phonetic.
The basic meaning is to retire, go into seclusion. Whether one does so because the 心 heart is content, or in mourning, seems to be a matter of interpretation. The 阝(阜) hills presumably would be the place where one goes to hide away. The simple form may be reinterpreted: to hide out of an 急 urgent need.
In 稳(穩) wěn 'steady', which has undergone the same simplification, the right hand component was simply phonetic (see also 瘾 yǐn 'addiction').
