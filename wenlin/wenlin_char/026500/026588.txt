1875 柜 [guì] (F櫃) (柜子) cabinet; 柜台 counter; 掌柜 shopkeeper  [jǔ]
柜/匮[櫃/匱] ³guì {E} b.f. cupboard; cabinet 柜子 guìzi* 衣柜 yīguì*
柜 ⁶jǔ char. 柜柳 jǔliǔ
Originally written 匱, from 匚 (fāng) (picture of a cabinet), and 貴 guì phonetic. 木 (mù) 'wood' was added, producing the full form 櫃.
In the simple form 柜, 匱 has been replaced by 巨 (jù). (Actually the character 柜 existed previously as an old form of 榉 jǔ.)
