查 Zhā n. Surname
Originally 査, from 木 (mù) 'wood' over 且 qiě phonetic, but the modern character is written with 旦 (dàn 'dawn') at the bottom. The original meaning was 'raft' (hence 木 'wood'); then the character was borrowed for the word chá 'examine' which happened to sound the same.
Not to be confused with 察 chá as in 观察 guānchá 'observe'.
