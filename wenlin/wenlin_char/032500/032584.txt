2036 罈(S坛) [tán] jar, jug
罈[坛] ⁶tán {E} b.f. jar 坛子 ¹tánzi
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 坛:) The simple form 坛 is composed of 土 (tǔ) 'earth' and 云 (yún 'cloud').
坛 corresponds to two different full forms, 壇 and 罈.
壇 is 土 plus 亶 dǎn phonetic.
罈 is 缶 (fǒu) 'jar' plus 覃 tán phonetic. The variant forms 罎 and 壜 have 曇 tán phonetic. 云 in 坛 evidently derives from the bottom of 曇.
