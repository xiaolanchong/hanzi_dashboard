968  篇 [piān] sheet of paper; piece of writing
篇 ¹piān {A} n. ①piece of writing ②sheet (of paper/etc.) ◆m. (for articles/chapters/etc.)
From 竹 (zhú) 'bamboo' and 扁 biǎn ('flat') phonetic.
In ancient times, 竹 bamboo strips were used for writing on. 扁 depicts a 册 (cè) document hung on a 户 (hù) door, so it is possible that 篇 piān and 扁 biǎn are cognate.
Compare 编(編) biān 'weave; edit', which contains 纟(糸 sī) 'thread' (think of an editor as someone who weaves words, to avoid confusing 篇 piān and 编 biān).
