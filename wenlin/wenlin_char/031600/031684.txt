(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 范:) From 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' over 氾 fàn phonetic.
范 is an old character, used among full form characters only as a surname. 范 is also used as the simple form of 範 fàn, which is composed of 竹 (zhú) 'bamboo' over 車 (chē) 'car' and 㔾 (a phonetic component).
Compare 犯 fàn 'criminal'.
