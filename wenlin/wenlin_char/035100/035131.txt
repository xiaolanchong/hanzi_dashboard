==== 褻(S亵) [xiè] undress; dirty; desecrate
褻[亵] ⁹xiè {E} b.f. ①irreverent; disrespectful 亵渎 xièdú ②obscene 秽亵 huìxiè
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 亵:) 衣 (yī) 'clothing' (split into top and bottom) suggests the meaning.
The middle part is 埶 yì (maybe phonetic) in the full form 褻 (sometimes however it is written with 執 zhí instead of 埶). In the simple form 亵 the middle is 执 zhí.
