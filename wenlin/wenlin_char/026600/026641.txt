对 (duì) yes, it is a 木 (mù) tree.
Actually, 树 shù has nothing to do with 对(對) duì; the full form 樹 has 壴 instead of 又 in the middle, the obsolete character 尌 shù being phonetic. 尌 is also phonetic in 厨 chú 'kitchen', where 壴 is abbreviated to 豆. There is also an obscure character 澍 shù 'timely rain'.
