栗 ¹²lì {E} b.f. chestnut 栗子 ²lìzi
栗[慄/凓] ¹³lì {E} b.f. tremble 颤栗 ²zhànlì
Picture of a chestnut tree. The top 覀 is similar to 西 xī 'west'. The bottom is 木 mù 'tree'.
"Chestnut -- in the seal the upper part is not 西 but the same picture of a fruit as in 粟" --Karlgren.
Compare 粟 sù 'grain'.
In the Confucian Analects (论语), 栗 lì means both 'chestnut' and 'tremble in fear': "周人以栗, 曰, 使民戰栗。The men of the Zhōu dynasty planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe." This was a pun on the two meanings of lì. The character 慄 (enlarged by 忄 'heart') is used interchangeably with 栗 among full form characters, as in 戰栗 or 戰慄.
Another variant form, specifically for 'shiver, tremble with cold' is 凓, enlarged by 冫 'ice'.
