==== 柰 [nài] a kind of apple
柰 ⁴nài char. 柰子 nàizi 柰花 nàihuā
From 木 (mù) 'tree' and 示 (shì 'altar').
The interpretation of 示 here is uncertain.
Don't confuse 柰 nài with 奈 nài, which has 大 in place of 木. In fact 奈 was originally just a variant of 柰. Then the character was borrowed for an abstract homophone nài as in 无可奈何 wúkěnàihé, and the modern standard is to use 奈 for the abstract word and 柰 for the original meaning (a kind of apple).
