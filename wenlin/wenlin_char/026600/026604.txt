"Choose...abridge...short note...visiting card --- to 八 divide a 束 bundle: choose" --Karlgren(1923).
Compare 束 shù 'bundle'. 柬 is etymologically the same word as 简 jiǎn 'simple' and 拣 jiǎn 'choose'.
As a component, 柬 becomes  in the simplified forms of 拣(揀) jiǎn 'choose', 炼(煉) liàn 'refine', and 练(練) liàn 'practice'. Please note that  is not the same as 东(東 dōng 'east') -- the third stroke is different.
