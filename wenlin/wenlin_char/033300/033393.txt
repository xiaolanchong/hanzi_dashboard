1368 艱(S艰) [jiān] 艱苦 jiānkǔ arduous, 艱難 jiānnán difficult
艱[艰] ¹³jiān {E} b.f. difficult; arduous 艰难 jiānnán 艰苦 ¹jiānkǔ
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 艰:) According to Karlgren(1940),  depicted a person with back-bound hands, in distress. 艮 gèn was added later (perhaps phonetic, though Karlgren says it was 壴 zhù 'drum' corrupted).
In the simple form 艰, the left side  is abbreviated to 又 (yòu), the same as in 汉(漢) hàn, 难(難) nán, and 叹(嘆) tàn.
