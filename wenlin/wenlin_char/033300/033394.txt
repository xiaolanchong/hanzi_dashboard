色 ¹shǎi(r) {E} n. 〈topo.〉 color
The primary meaning is 'facial expression'. The top ⺈ seems to have originally been 人 (rén) 'person'. The bottom, now 巴 (bā), seems to derive from 卩 (jié) a person kneeling. Since 卩 at one time meant 'seal' (for stamping letters), a traditional explanation is that 色 means the color of ink.
"That which a 人 man uses for his 卩 seal: printing ink, color" --Karlgren.
"The color of the face corresponds with the feelings of the heart, as the stamp reproduces the seal" --Wieger.
色 is the 139th of the 214 radicals.
Compare 绝 jué.
