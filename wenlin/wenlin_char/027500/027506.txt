(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 岁:) From 戌 xū phonetic and 步 (bù) 'step'. 步 was cut into two pieces, the top going over 戌 and the bottom going inside 戌.
In the simple form 岁, the top 止 has been altered to 山 (shān 'mountain'), and the whole lower part replaced by 夕 (xī 'evening').
Compare 梦(夢) mèng 'dream'.
