殼[壳] ³qiào {E} n. shell; crust
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 壳:) Originally like 南 (nán 'south'), apparently depicting a percussion instrument, plus 殳 (shū) a hand holding a mallet to strike the instrument. The simple form 壳 omits 殳, and also leaves out the 一 horizontal stroke between 冖 and 几.
殼 (minus the bottom-left part 几) is phonetic in 穀彀榖毂糓觳轂縠嗀; in each of these characters a signific component is located in the bottom left corner.
A variant form is 殻 (one stroke less than 殼).
