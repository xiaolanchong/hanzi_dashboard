==== 毂(F轂) [gǔ] hub of a wheel  [gū] (variant of 轱 in 轱辘)
轱/毂[軲/轂] ⁹gū {E} char. 轱辘 ¹gūlu(r)*
毂[轂] ¹⁰gǔ n. hub
From 壳(殻) ké phonetic (slightly distorted), and 车(車 chē) 'car'.
In the full form 轂, there is a 一 horizontal stroke between 冖 and 車, so the lower left is NOT the same as 軍 (jūn). In the simple form 毂, the 一 horizontal stroke disappears, so the lower left coincidentally looks like 军 (jūn).
