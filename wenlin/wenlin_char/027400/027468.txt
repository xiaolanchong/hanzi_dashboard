708  歌 [gē] song
歌 ¹gē {A} n. song M:²shǒu/⁴zhī 首/支 ◆b.f. sing 歌唱 gēchàng
From 哥 gē 'brother' and 欠 qiàn 'yawn'.
哥 gē is 可 kě 'can' doubled. Either 哥 gē is phonetic in 歌 gē, or 哥 may have been an earlier form of gē 'song' (note that 可 is from 口 kǒu 'mouth' and 丂 qiǎo 'exclamation'); in that case 哥 was borrowed for the homophone gē 'brother', and 欠, meaning to open the mouth wide, was
added for the original meaning 'song'.
