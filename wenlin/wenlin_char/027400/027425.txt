From 冫(二 èr) 'two' and 欠 (qiàn) 'yawn; owe'.
The basic meaning is 'secondary, inferior'. 二 'two' indicates the meaning 'secondary'. 欠 depicts a person with mouth wide open, gasping for air, perhaps having come in second place in a race; 欠 also means 'lacking, deficient', not good enough for first place.
The extended meaning is succession of occurences: first, second, third, etc.
次 is phonetic in 资 (资本 zīběn), 姿 (姿势 zīshì), etc.
