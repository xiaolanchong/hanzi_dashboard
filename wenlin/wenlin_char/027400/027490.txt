Picture of a left footprint. The toes were at the top, the heel at the bottom. Sometimes written , as in 走 zǒu. See 足 zú 'foot', 步 bù 'step', and 疋 shū.
止 zhǐ now means 'stop' (hold the feet still). The original meaning 'foot' survives in 趾 zhǐ as in 脚趾 jiǎozhǐ 'toe'. Also, 址 zhǐ as in 地址 dìzhǐ 'address' is etymologically the same word.
止 is the 77th of the 214 radicals.
