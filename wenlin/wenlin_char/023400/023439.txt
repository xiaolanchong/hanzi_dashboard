1846 宏 [hóng] 宏伟 magnificient; 宏大 great; 宏观 macroscopic
宏/弘 ⁵hóng {E} b.f. great; grand; magnificent 宏大 ¹hóngdà* 恢宏 huīhóng
From 宀 (mián) 'roof' and 厷 gōng phonetic.
Compare 雄 xióng, which is similar in meaning (in particular, 宏伟 hóngwěi and 雄伟 xióngwěi both mean 'magnificient'). Also compare 弘 hóng; hóngdà 'great' is written either 宏大 or 弘大; 宏 and 弘 are interchanged in quite a few words, but it isn't clear whether they are etymologically the same.
