---- 孽 [niè] (罪孽 zuìniè) evil, sin
孽 ²niè {E} b.f. ①monster; demon 妖孽 yāoniè* ②evil; sin 罪孽 zuìniè ③seed of evil 孽种 nièzhǒng ④concubine's son; illegitimate child 孽子 nièzǐ
Composed of 薛 (Xuē) over 子 (zǐ) 'child'. Originally from a (now obsolete) character 山 over 𠂤, which was phonetic; and 辛 'criminal' and 子 'child'. The top got changed to 薛 (Xuē, a surname) through confusion.
"Bastard, concubine's son; misfortune, ill-omen -- 辛 (criminal's:) slave's 子 son, signific; the ...form with 薛 at the top is really erroneous, though very common" --Karlgren.
Compare 蘖.
