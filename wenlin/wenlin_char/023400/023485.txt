The top is 宀 (mián) 'roof'; ideally a roof should be wide. The lower part was a picture of a goat, an obsolete character meaning 'goat' and pronounced similarly to kuān, used as a phonetic. It differed from 莧 by having an extra dot. But in the simple form, the extra dot is omitted and 宽 consists of 宀 and 苋, or 宀, 艹 and 见.
