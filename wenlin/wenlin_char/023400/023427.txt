它[-/牠] ³tā {A} pr. ①it; they (neologism for ¹tā) (referring to inanimate things in object position) | Lí dōu làn le, zuìhǎo bǎ ∼ rēng le. 梨都烂了, 最好把∼扔了。 ②this; that
Picture of a snake. Now 'snake' is 蛇 shé. 它 was borrowed long ago as a phonetic-loan character for the third-person pronoun tā 'he, she, it'. Sometimes it was written 佗, which became 他. Only in modern times was a distinction made (in writing) between 他 tā 'he', 她 tā 'she', and 它 tā 'it'.
它 tā and 也 yě 'also' may have originally been a single character.
Another character 牠 tā is also used for 'it' (especially for animals, only among full form characters).
