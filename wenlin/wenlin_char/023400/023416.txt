(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 学:) The top 𦥯 shows two hands around 爻 (yáo) lines in the symbols of the 易经 Yì Jīng Book of Changes, over 冖 something like a cover. One uncovers the truth by grasping the 爻 changes. 子 (zǐ) 'child' was added to the bottom since children are good at learning.
The simple form 学, in which the top is three dots, is at least as old as the fourth century A.D. Distinguish it from 字 zì which has only one dot on top. Compare 觉(覺) jué 'feel' and 教 jiāo jiào 'teach'.
