1385 宾(F賓) [bīn] guest; 宾馆 bīnguǎn hotel
宾[賓] ¹bīn {E} b.f. ①guest 来宾 láibīn ②〈lg.〉 object 宾语 bīnyǔ
From 宀 (mián) 'roof' and 兵 bīng phonetic.
The full form 賓 is from an obsolete character (originally composed of 宀 and 丏 miàn) which meant "secret union" (--Kargren), and 貝 money (possibly because guests bring gifts, or because guests are themselves valuable: consider the phrase 貴賓 guìbīn).
