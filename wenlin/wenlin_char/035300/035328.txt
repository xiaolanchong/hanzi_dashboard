"Picture of a flute with a mouth blowing into it" --Lindqvist.
Originally 言 looked the same as 音 yīn 'sound', the only difference being the extra line sometimes added inside the mouth, forming 曰 at the bottom of 音. 言 yán and 音 yīn may be cognates.
As a component, 言 becomes 讠 in simple form characters when it occurs on the left side of a character (as in 语 etc.). It is the 149th of the 214 Kāngxī radicals.
