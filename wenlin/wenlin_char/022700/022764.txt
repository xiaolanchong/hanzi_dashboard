---- 壬 [rén] Ninth of the ten heavenly stems (天干)
壬 ³rén n. 9th of the 10 Heavenly Stems
壬 rén depicts "a 丨 carrying pole supported 一 in the middle part and having one object attached at each end, as always done in China" --Karlgren(1923). (See 扁担 biǎndan).
Now the character 任 rèn has the meaning of carrying a burden, and the original character 壬 is used only for the ninth of the ten heavenly stems (天干).
Another old character, which now only occurs as a component in other characters, is now written the same way: 壬. It depicted a 人 person standing on the 土 ground. The pronunciation would be tǐng if it weren't obsolete; it is a phonetic component in 廷 tíng, 呈 chéng, 聽 tīng, etc.
Don't confuse 壬 rén with 王 wáng 'king'.
