A foot pointing downward, originally written like 止 zhǐ upside-down.
Three strokes, one less than 攵(攴 pū) 'beat'.
夂 is a common component, traditionally considered to mean 'walk slowly'. It has been called a picture of a ⺈ person with  something tied to the legs, or a cane; this may have simply been a misinterpretation of the shape which, at least in most cases, was originally just 止 upside-down.
In dictionaries organized by the traditional 214 Kangxi radicals, the 35th radical 夊 suī is distinguished from the 34th radical 夂 zhǐ, although they are generally both written 夂. When 夂 occurs at the top of a character, it's radical 34 (夂 zhǐ); at the bottom, it's radical 35 (夊 suī).
