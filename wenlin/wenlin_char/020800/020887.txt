---- 冗 [rǒng] superfluous; full of trivial details
冗 ¹rǒng {E} b.f. ①superfluous; redundant 冗笔 rǒngbǐ ②busy schedule 拨冗 bōrǒng
From 冖 (mì) 'cover' (formerly 宀 mián 'roof'), over 几(人 rén) 'person'.
"儿 man, 宀 loitering at home, waiting for affairs to turn up"  --Karlgren(1923).
"Supernumerary officials without definite tasks . . . Explanation of graph uncertain" --Karlgren(1940).
冗 rǒng has nothing to do with 沉 chén 'heavy'.
