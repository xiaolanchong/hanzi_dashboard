One theory is that 全 comes from  ( = 集 jí 'gather'), over 工 gōng 'work': the  whole 工 works. The vertical 丨 stroke of 工 is extended upward to join the horizontal stroke of . Or it could be that the bottom was 玉 yù, a perfect piece of jade. There might also be some relation to 合 hé, and 仝(同 tóng) 'together'.
