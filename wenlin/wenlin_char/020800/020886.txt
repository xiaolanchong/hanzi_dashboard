No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
Fourteenth of the 214 radicals.
Old form of 幂 mì 'cloth cover'.
The first stroke is a left-falling 丶 diǎn 'dot' (not 丿 piě).
The popular names 平宝盖 píngbǎogài and 秃宝盖 tūbǎogài indicate that the top is 'flat' (平 píng) or 'bald' (秃 tū), to distinguish 冖 from 宀 (mián), which has a dot on top and is called simply 宝盖 bǎogài.
