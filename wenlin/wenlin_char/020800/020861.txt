2189 兽(F獸) [shòu] beast
兽[獸] ³shòu {E} b.f. ①beast; wild animal 野兽 yěshòu* ②beastly; crude; uncivilized 兽行 ²shòuxíng
The full form 獸 has 犬 (quǎn) 'dog' (a hunting dog) on the right side. The remainder, 嘼, is of uncertain origin. Lindqvist proposes, on the basis of oracle-bone characters and other archeological evidence, that it may represent hunting stones tied with a rope. Compare 单(單) dān.
In the simple form 兽, 犬 has been left out and the top 吅 has become 丷 two strokes.
