428  克 [kè] (克服 kèfú) overcome; gram; (F剋) 克期 set time limit  [kēi] (=剋)
克[剋/尅] ⁴kè {A} b.f. ①overcome 克服 kèfú* ②subdue; capture (city/etc.) 攻克 ²gōngkè ③restrain 克己 kèjǐ ④digest 克食 ²kèshí ⑤set a time limit 克期 ¹kèqī ⑥can; be able to ◆v. 〈coll.〉 bully ◆m. gram
剋/尅/克 kēi v. 〈coll.〉 reprimand; scold
克 used to look like 皮 (pí) 'skin', minus 又 (yòu) 'hand', plus an extra thing on top. It resembled 革 (gé) 'leather', which depicts an animal being flayed. To overcome an animal?
Anyway, 克 kè appears to have no historical relation to 古 gǔ or 兄 xiōng.
The variant form 剋 has 刂(刀 dāo) 'knife' added. Another variant, 尅, has 寸 (cùn) 'hand' added.
Supplemental notes:
“肩也象屋下刻木之形”--说文解字。
"Shoulder; picture of chopping wood below a building" --Shuo Wen.
I'm not sure if I've translated Shuo Wen correctly here, and I'm not sure what it means. "Shoulder" appears to be a verb (i.e. "support, endure"). The top could be analogous to 高 and 亭, pictures of buildings. The bottom represents cutting/carving wood? chopping down a tree?
Wieger's explanation is:
"The top part is 高 contracted, that means, pressure from upwards, a weight that hangs heavily. Some say, the bottom is 肩 shoulder, contracted. A load that weighs heavy upon the shoulders; 以肩任物曰克。物高于肩, 故从高省。下象肩形。The lower part seems rather to be a primitive, representing the idea of bending under 古 a load."
---That is almost surely nonsense.
"A cleaver with a handle for skinning animals, a flaying tool" says 王宏源. But the "handle" seems to correspond with one of the sides of the flayed animal 革, in which case it is skin, not a handle.
汉字演变五百例 says that the bottom (兄) depicts a living animal (a lion?) with its mouth open wide, and the top (十) is an axe head "overcoming" the beast.
