"廾() two hands handling 目 something which the commentators say is 貝 money abbreviated but which may have been simply a picture of some implement" --Karlgren. (An old form is 𥃲.)
Judging from the ancient bronze character, the top really was 貝 bèi (cowrie:) money, suggesting the meaning 'possess' rather than 'tool'.
"A cowrie shell and two hands: to acquire, to prepare and tool, implement" --Lindqvist.
Compare 得 dé 'obtain', which was originally 寸 one hand and 貝 money.
