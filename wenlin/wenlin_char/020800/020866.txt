==== 冂 [jiōng] (radical 13, component: 同字框 tóngzìkuàng)  [jiǒng] empty
No common single-syllable words.
Thirteenth of the 214 radicals.
No longer a word or a whole character in modern Chinese. 冂 was formerly also written 冋, in which 囗 depicted the border of a city, and 冂 depicted the area beyond the border; 坰 jiōng 'distant outskirts of city' is the same character elaborated by 土 (tǔ) 'territory'. 迥 jiǒng 'distant' is related.
An alternative explanation is that 冂 depicted a door-frame, and is related to 扃 jiōng 'shut a door' (which contains 冋 jiōng as a component, which in turn contains 冂.)
