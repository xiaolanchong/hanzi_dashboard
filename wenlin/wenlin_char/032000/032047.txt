累[纍] ³léi {E} char. 累赘 léizhui 累累 léiléi
累 ³lěi {E} b.f. ①pile up; accumulate 积累 jīlěi* ②involve 累及 lěijí
From 田 (tián) 'field' and 糸 (sī) 'thread'.
Originally 纍, from 畾 léi phonetic over 糸 'thread'. Long ago the simple form 累, with a single 田, came into use for the pronunciation lèi, 纍 being preserved for the pronunciation léi. Among modern simple form characters only 累 is used for all pronunciations. 畾 léi also occurred in 雷 léi 'thunder', where it has also been simplified to 田. See 儡 (傀儡 kuǐlěi 'puppet') and 垒(壘) lěi 'pile up'.
The primitive meaning of 累(纍) was 'bind', hence 糸 'thread', and the extended meanings: tie up, gather, accumulate, build up, get deeply involved, work hard, tired.
