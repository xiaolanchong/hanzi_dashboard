(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 纪:) From 纟(糸 sī) 'silk thread' and 己 jǐ.
"Unravel threads; arrange, regulate, law; to record, year, age, dynasty" --Karlgren.
This was the original meaning of 己 jǐ, and when 己 was borrowed for the sixth 天干 (and also the meaning 'self'), 糸 was added to produce 紀. Now 纪 jì is pronounced in the fourth (falling) tone, but when used as a proper name, it is Jǐ.
It seems likely that 记 jì 'record, remember' is etymologically the same word, considering the overlap in meaning. Some words can be written with either 纪 or 记: 记录(纪录) 'keep minutes', 纪要(记要) 'summary of minutes'. (However, Karlgren makes no mention of the possibility of 纪 and 记 being etymologically related, nor of 己 being a picture of threads.)
