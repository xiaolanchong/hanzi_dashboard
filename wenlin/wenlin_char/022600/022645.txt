1681 塵(S尘) [chén] (灰塵 huīchén) dust
塵[尘] ³chén {E} b.f. ①dust; dirt 灰尘 huīchén ②this world 红尘 hóngchén*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 尘:) The full form 塵 is 鹿 (lù) 'deer' over 土 (tǔ) 'dirt', and in the seal there were three 鹿 deer:
"The 土 dust cloud after running deer" --Karlgren(1923).
The simple form 尘 has 小 (xiǎo) 'small' in place of 鹿. It is NOT the same as 尖 jiān 'tip'. The form 尘 dates to the 17th century.
