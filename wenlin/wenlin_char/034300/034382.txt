The form on the far left is very old, from an inscription in bronze from the 商 Shāng dynasty (16th to 11th centuries B.C.). Obviously it is a picture of a tiger. But as it became distorted, people couldn't tell what it was and interpreted it as a picture of the tiger's stripes only. The form 虍 was then enlarged by adding 儿 feet, even though it already had feet, except that you can't really tell where the feet are in 虍. So the modern form is 虎, while 虍 occurs as a part of other characters such as 虑 lǜ 'consider', etc.
虎 (or 虍) is the 141st of the 214 radicals.
