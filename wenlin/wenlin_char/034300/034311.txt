(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 苏:) 办 here is a simplification of 稣 sū 'revive', which is from 鱼 (yú) 'fish' and 禾 (hé) 'grain'. 稣 sū originally meant 'harvest feast', 鱼 and 禾 being items on the menu. The meaning was extended to 'revive', to come back to the good life after gathering the harvest. The 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' was added to form a character meaning 'perilla' (thyme?); then the new character with 艹 on top was often used in place of 稣. “‘苏’字是一个约定俗成的新简化字。1935年由200为知名人士和15个社团联合发起制定的首先提出以‘苏’代‘蘇’; 同年由当时的教育部公布的也把‘苏’列入敌意郫24个简体字之一。...” (李乐毅, 《简化字源》 p.230). 李乐毅 also describes the use of 苏 to replace 囌 (in 噜苏) and 甦.
