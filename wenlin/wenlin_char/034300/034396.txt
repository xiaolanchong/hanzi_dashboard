虜/擄[虏/掳] ³lǔ {E} b.f. ①capture; prisoner 虏获 lǔhuò 俘虏 fúlǔ* ②loot; capture 掳掠 lǔlüè
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 虏:) From 虍(虎) hǔ 'tiger' and 力 (lì) 'strength'.
The full form 虜 also contains 田, which here was not originally tián 'field' but the top of 貫 guàn, meaning 'bind'.
虍(虎) hǔ 'tiger' could be phonetic or signific.
Also written 掳(擄), with (手 shǒu) 'hand' added.
