2474 粘 [zhān] to glue, to paste   [nián] ( = 黏)
粘 ²zhān {B} v. glue; stick; paste
黏/粘 ²nián {E} s.v. sticky; glutinous | Zhè mị̌ hěn ∼. 这米很∼。 This rice is very sticky. ◆v. adhere; stick
From 米 'rice' and 占 zhàn.
Sometimes 粘 is used as the simple form of 黏 nián 'sticky'; in fact, the 汉字正字手册 says that this is correct. But some dictionaries differentiate between 粘 and 黏, including 频率词典.
