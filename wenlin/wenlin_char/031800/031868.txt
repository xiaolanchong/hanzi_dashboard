==== 籼(F秈) [xiān] ordinary (non-glutinous) rice
籼[秈] ⁹xiān b.f. long-grain non-glutinous rice 籼米 xiānmǐ 籼稻 ³xiāndào
From 米 (mǐ) 'rice' or 禾 (hé) 'grain', and 山 shān phonetic.
Strangely enough, we call 籼 the "simple" form and 秈 the "full" form, only because 籼 is in the simple-form GB standard and 秈 is in the full-form Big5 standard. This is one of those absurd situations where the "simple" form has more strokes than the "full" form.
秈 (玉篇, 543 A.D.) seems to be older than 籼 (集韵, 1067 A.D.).
