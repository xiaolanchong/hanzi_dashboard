==== 穌(S稣) [sū] revive, come to; 耶穌 Yēsū Jesus
穌[稣] ²sū {E} char. 耶稣 Yēsū
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 稣:) From 鱼(魚 yú) 'fish' and 禾 (hé) 'grain'.
"Gather the harvest; (harvest feast:) enjoy the repose, revive... 禾 grain and 魚 fish: harvest feast..." --Karlgren.
Mostly replaced by 苏(蘇) sū, in which 办 is simplified from 穌.
A well-chosen character for transcribing 耶稣 Jesus (came back to life).
