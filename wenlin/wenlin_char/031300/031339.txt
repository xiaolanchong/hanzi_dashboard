694  穫(S获) [huò] reap, cut grain; 收穫 shōuhuò harvest  [hù]
穫[获] ⁵huò {E} b.f. reap; harvest; gather in 收获 ¹shōuhuò*
Distinguish 穫 from 獲 huò 'obtain'. Both 穫 and 獲 have the same simple form 获.
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 获:) Two 犭犬 (quǎn) dogs in the 艹(草 cǎo) grass: hunting, catching things.
The simple form 获 corresponds to two full form characters: 獲 and 穫. Both contain 蒦 huò phonetic. 獲 contains 犭(犬 quǎn) 'dog' and means 'catch, obtain', whereas 穫 contains 禾 (hé) 'grain' and means 'harvest'.
The form 獲 was altered by making 艹 go all the way across the top, then 隹 and 又 were replaced by 犬, to give the modern simple form 获.
