1097 穩(S稳) [wěn] (穩定 wěndìng) stable, steady; 穩當 wěndang reliable
穩[稳] ¹wěn {B} s.v. ①firm; stable; steady ②staid; sedate ③sure; certain
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 稳:) The right side was originally from 㥯 yǐn phonetic, simplified to 急 (jí 'urgent'); compare 隐(隱). I can't explain the role of 禾 hé 'grain'.
