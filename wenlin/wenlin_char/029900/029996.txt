Primitive meaning: 'burst forth'. Composed of 龴 and 用 yòng phonetic. Here 龴 may derive from an obsolete character that meant 'to sprout'; the same obsolete character became the right side of 犯 fàn. Henshall shows an old form of 甬 in which the top is 日 (rì) 'sun'.
甬 yǒng is phonetic in 通 tōng, 痛 tòng, 勇 yǒng, 涌 yǒng, etc.
