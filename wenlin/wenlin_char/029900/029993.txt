2470 甩 [shuǎi] swing back & forth; toss; get rid of
甩 shuǎi {B} v. ①move backward and forward | ∼∼ gēbei. ∼∼胳臂。 Move the arms backward and forward. ②throw ③leave sb. behind; throw off
I can't find the shape of 甩 explained anywhere. It appears to be derived from 用 yòng 'use', with the last stroke bent to the right. Maybe it means to 用 use, and then toss away, discard, abandon.
