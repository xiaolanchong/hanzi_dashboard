2076 蒸 [zhēng] (蒸汽 zhēngqì) steam
蒸 ³zhēng {D} b.f. ①evaporate 蒸发 ¹zhēngfā* ②steam 蒸气 ²zhēngqì ◆v. to steam (in food preparation)
Originally written 烝, from 丞 chéng phonetic and 灬 (火 huǒ) 'fire'. 艹(草 cǎo) 'plant', which was added later, might represent the wood used as fuel, or vegetables being steamed.
"Firewood, to smoke, to steam; rise; all" --Karlgren(1923).
The older character 烝 is now used in the extended sense 'multitude'.
