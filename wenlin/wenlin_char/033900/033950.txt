==== 蒞(S莅) [lì] (蒞臨 lìlín) arrive, be present
蒞[莅] ³²lì b.f. arrive; be present 莅临 lìlín 莅会 ²lìhuì 莅任 ³lìrèn
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 莅:) From 艹(艸 cǎo) 'grass' and 位 (wèi) 'position' or 涖 lì phonetic. (立 lì might be phonetic.)
"Arrange, manage, transact." --Karlgren(1923). Karlgren says the function of 位 in 莅 is uncertain; by glossing the full form 蒞 as "same word as 莅", he seems to give precedence to the simple form 莅. 漢語大字典 does the same. 正字通 says "蒞, 俗莅字".
說文解字 has none of the characters 莅, 蒞, or 涖. Instead it has an obsolete character composed of 立 plus 隶, of which 集韻 says "或作莅, 蒞" (see 漢語大字典 pages 3221, 3270, and 2713).
We treat 蒞 as the "full form", rather than a "variant form", to accomodate the Big5 standard, from which 莅 is missing.
