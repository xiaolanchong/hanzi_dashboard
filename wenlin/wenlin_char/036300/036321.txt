(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 迹:) From 亦 yì phonetic and 辶(辵 chuò) 'go' or ⻊(足 zú) 'foot'.
"Footprint, track; trace, vestige; to track, examine; follow in the wake of" --Karlgren(1923).
Formerly the standard pronunciation of 迹 was jī, but it was officially changed to jì in 1985 (普通话异读词审音表), presumably to reflect actual common usage.
