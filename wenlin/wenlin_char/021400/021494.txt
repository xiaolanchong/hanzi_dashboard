The old form 枼 is 世 (shì) 'generation' over 木 (mù) 'tree'.
"Explained as the 世 successive 'generations' of the 木 tree -- the leaves reappearing yearly; originally perhaps only a picture of the foliage of the 木 tree" --Karlgren(1923).
The full form 葉 has 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' added.
The simple form 叶 is completely different, from 口 and 十. It could represent a 十 twig (compare 个), with one 口 leaf on it. 叶 is listed in 说文解字 as a variant of 协(協) xié, meaning 'harmonize', and might be 十 ten 口 mouths singing in harmony. It seems to have been borrowed as a phonetic loan to substitute for 葉.
Compare 业(業) yè 'property' which, like 葉, depicts foliage. Also compare 页(頁) yè 'head; page or leaf (of book)'. The similarities in sound and meaning between 叶 yè, 页 yè and 业 yè seem to be coincidental, since the Archaic sounds were all different (initial consonants d-, g- and ng- according to Karlgren).
The old form 枼 is a component in 蝶碟牒 dié etc.
