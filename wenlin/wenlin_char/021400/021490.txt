"Hand holding a style (pen) and writing on a 囗 wooden block" --Karlgren.
It isn't clear what the hand was originally holding; it looked like 中 (zhōng) 'middle' in the oldest characters. It appears that 史 shǐ 'history', 事 shì 'event', and 吏 lì 'officer', and the right side of 使 shǐ 'make' were all originally the same: a hand holding some unknown object. These words are believed to be cognates.
