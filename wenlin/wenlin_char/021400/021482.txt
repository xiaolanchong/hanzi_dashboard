A 口 (kǒu) mouth with 八 (bā) two lines issuing from it, signifying 'only' -- in traditional top-to-bottom writing, the two strokes point to the words which follow, perhaps to indicate the limited scope of those words, as the two strokes in 小 mean 'small'. 说文 says 八 is “气下引之形”, the shape of qì breath (or vital energy) leading downwards.
The measure word 只(隻) zhī has a different origin; the full form 隻 is 隹 (zhuī) 'bird' over 又 (yòu) 'hand': "single bird; one of a pair ...single piece" --Karlgren. Compare 双(雙) shuāng, a pair of birds.
