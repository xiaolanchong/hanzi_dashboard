A 爫 hand reaching down, giving, and a 又() hand reaching up, receiving a 冖 thing. In some ancient forms the 冖 thing was a 舟 boat. Possibly the hands are unloading (receiving) goods from the boat. According to Zhōu Fǎgāo the thing was a tray before it was a boat, and 舟 zhōu was substituted as a phonetic component to suggest the sound shòu.
Compare 授 shòu 'give, award', which is etymologically the same word as 受 shòu.
Also compare 收 shōu 'receive' which is similar in meaning and sound (shōu versus shòu), but used differently from 受 shòu.
