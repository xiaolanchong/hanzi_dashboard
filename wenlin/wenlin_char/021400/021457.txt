The full form 發 is 癶 bò phonetic over 弓殳: to 殳 (shū) launch arrows with a 弓 (gōng) bow. (癶 also suggests the meaning: two 止 feet, "separation, divergence, letting loose" --Wieger). An old form had 矢 shǐ 'arrow' instead of 殳.
发 fà 'hair' has a different origin. The full form 髮 is 髟 biāo 'hair' (長 long 彡 hair) on top of 犮 (the right side of 拔 bá) phonetic (which is unrelated to 发). The similarity between 拔 and 发 is coincidental. Anyway, there is a single simple form: 发 fā 'emit', fà 'hair'.
