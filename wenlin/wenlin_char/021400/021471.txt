---- 叟 [sǒu] old man  [sōu] [xiāo]
叟 ¹sǒu {E} b.f. old man 野叟 yěsǒu
Originally written 叜, from 宀 'roof', 火 'fire', and 又 'hand'. This was the original form of 搜 sōu 'search': searching a house, holding a torch in the hand.
The character became altered to 叟 and was borrowed for the word sǒu 'old man', and 扌(手 shǒu) 'hand' was added for the original meaning 搜 sōu 'search'.
