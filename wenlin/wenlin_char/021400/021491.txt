Originally , a picture of the right hand.  was borrowed for the homophonous word yòu 'again', the shape slightly altered to 又.
For the original meaning 'right hand', 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' was added to , signifying the hand which you 口 eat with. The top  was altered to 𠂇.
The top of 左 zuǒ 'left' was originally , the mirror image of . Now the tops of 左 zuǒ and 右 yòu are both 𠂇.
