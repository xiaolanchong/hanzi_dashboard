台 and 臺 were two separate characters, and 臺 is still sometimes used among full form characters. 台 is used as the simple form of 臺.
台 is (厶) breath, over 口 mouth. Once it meant 'I, we':
"The 口 mouth exhaling a  breath. By extension, to speak in order to make one's self known; I, one's self; 说也。" --Wieger.
台 also was the name of certain stars in Ursa Major.
"The character is now mostly used as a conventional abbreviation for 臺" --Karlgren.
臺 is 吉 over 冖 over 至. It is a picture of a tower, like 高 and 京. Hence, an elevated place, platform, terrace.
