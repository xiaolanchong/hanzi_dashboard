No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
Originally written 厶: a bent arm. Enlarged by  (now 𠂇), picture of a right hand, giving 厷.
The modern form is 肱 gōng 'upper arm', which is enlarged again by 月(肉 ròu) 'flesh'. 厷 now occurs only as a component in 肱 gōng, 雄 xióng, 宏 hóng, etc.
