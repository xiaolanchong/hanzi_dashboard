---- 橘 [jú] (橘子 júzi) tangerine (also written 桔 jú)
橘 ²jú {E} b.f. tangerine; orange 橘子 ¹júzi*
From 木 (mù) 'tree' and 矞 yù phonetic.
The right side 矞 yù is an obsolete character, used in 橘 as a phonetic component. Since 橘 is hard to write, often the character 桔 jú (From 木 (mù) 'tree' and 吉) is used instead.
Compare 鹬 yù and 谲 jué.
