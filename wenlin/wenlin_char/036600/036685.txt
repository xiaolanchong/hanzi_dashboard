---- 轍(S辙) [zhé] (車轍) rut; rhyme; way
轍[辙] ²zhé {E} n. ①ruts; wheel tracks ②route ③rhyme (of a song/etc.) ④〈topo.〉 way; method
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 辙:) The left side is 车(車 chē) 'car'.
The right side  is 育 (yù) 'nourish' plus 攵(攴 pū) 'beat'. It is the same as the right side of 徹(彻) chè 'thorough'. Probably 辙 zhé 'rut' and 徹(彻) chè 'thorough' are cognates: a rut is a place in the road that has been thoroughly worn down.
