633  哪 [nǎ] [něi] what; 哪儿 nǎr where   [na] (=啊 a)  [Né] [nuó] [nǎi] [nà] [niè]
哪/那 nǎ {A} pr. which; what; how
哪/呐[-/吶] na {A} m.p. (formed by linking syllable ending in n with the particle a) | Xièxie nín ∼. 谢谢您∼。 Thank you.
哪 ¹něi {E} intj. 〈coll.〉 which?; what?; how?
哪 Né char. 哪吒 Nézhā
From 口 (kǒu) 'mouth' and 那 nà 'that'.
In old-fashioned writing, sometimes 哪 is written 那, without 口, so that one has to guess from context whether it is nǎ 'what' or nà 'that'.
