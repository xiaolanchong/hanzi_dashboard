This character has no direct explanation in available dictionaries. The top seems to be 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' and the bottom 朋 (péng) 'friend'. It is component in 蒯 kuǎi and also in 𦘃𧽹𩕕𦗿; although 萠 is sometimes said to be a variant of 萌 méng (as in Unihan kDefinition data, citing no authority; and hence the méng reading), in compounds 萠 it seems to be a variant of 􀆙 (𦳋蒯), in which 朋 would be an abbreviation of the left-side component 𣦵 (歺歹).
