2229 萍 [píng] 浮萍 fúpíng duckweed
萍 ⁷píng {E} b.f. duckweed 萍泊 píngbó 浮萍 fúpíng*
From 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' and 泙 píng ('valley') phonetic.
Some scholars believe that 平 originally depicted floating duckweed (rather than a balance), in which case the character 萍 was created after 平 was borrowed for the meaning 'level'.
