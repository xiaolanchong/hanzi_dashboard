率 ¹shuài {E} b.f. ①lead; command 率领 shuàilǐng* ②〈wr.〉 follow; obey ③cursory 草率 cǎoshuài ④straightforward 坦率 tǎnshuài ⑤rash; hasty ⑥generally; mostly 大率 ²dàshuài ◆n. 〈wr.〉 net (to catch birds)
Said (by 说文) to depict a net for catching birds (like 毕畢 bì), but the oldest forms of 率 are simply 幺 (yāo) 'silk cocoons' surrounded by short strokes (threads?).
"Picture of a net; etymologically same word as 帅" --Karlgren.
It isn't clear how there came to be two such different pronunciations, shuài and lǜ, for the single character 率. The pronunciation lǜ is mentioned by neither Wieger nor Karlgren.
