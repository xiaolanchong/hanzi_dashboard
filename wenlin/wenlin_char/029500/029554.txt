Distinguish 獲 from 穫 huò, which is also simplified to 获.
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 获:) Two 犭犬 (quǎn) dogs in the 艹(草 cǎo) grass: hunting, catching things.
The simple form 获 corresponds to two full form characters: 獲 and 穫. Both contain 蒦 huò phonetic. 獲 contains 犭(犬 quǎn) 'dog' and means 'catch, obtain', whereas 穫 contains 禾 (hé) 'grain' and means 'harvest'.
The form 獲 was altered by making 艹 go all the way across the top, then 隹 and 又 were replaced by 犬, to give the modern simple form 获.
