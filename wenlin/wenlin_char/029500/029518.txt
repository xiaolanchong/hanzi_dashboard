1051 獎(S奖) [jiǎng] prize, award; 獎金 bonus; 獎學金 scholarship
獎[奖] ²jiǎng {B} n. award; prize; reward ◆v. give a prize/award ◆b.f. encourage; praise; reward 奖励 jiǎnglì*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 奖:) From (将將) jiāng phonetic over 犬 (quǎn) 'dog' or 大 (dà) 'big'.
The original meaning had something to do with dogs and discipline (嗾犬厲之); the original "prize" might have been a bone. The dot in 犬 is missing from the variant form 奬 and the simple form 奖.
