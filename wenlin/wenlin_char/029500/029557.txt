2275 獵(S猎) [liè] 打獵 hunt; 獵人 hunter; 獵狗 hound
獵[猎] ⁵liè {E} b.f. hunt; chase 打猎 ¹dǎliè
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 猎:) From 犭(犬 quǎn) 'dog' and 巤 liè phonetic.
In the simple form 猎, 巤 is replaced by 昔, as with 蜡(蠟) là 'wax' and 腊(臘) là (腊肠 'sausage'). (But 昔 xī is the original phonetic in 错 cuò, 惜 xī, 借 jiè etc.)
