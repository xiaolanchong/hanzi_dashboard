儿 (two strokes) depicts a person; originally it was identical to 人 rén. It is the tenth of the 214 radicals. As a radical, its traditional name is rén. It usually occurs at the bottom of characters (元先光充見竟...).
儿 is now used as the simplifed form of 兒 ér 'child', whose full form 兒 has 臼 (jiù) for a head.
