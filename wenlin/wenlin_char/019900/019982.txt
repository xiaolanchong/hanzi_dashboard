Originally from 一 (yī) 'one' and 勺 (sháo) 'spoon'. The meaning was 'give, grant'; possibly to give one spoonful of food to a child.
The full form 與 was made by adding 舁 yú 'lift' (two pairs of hands) to 与. 舁 yú was phonetic; two pairs of hands also could depict the giver and the receiver.
Compare 兴(興) xìng (the full forms are similar).
