"A 木 tree crowded with its 丵 foliage. The moral foliage, the deeds of a man, the affairs upon which he exerts his activity, and what he acquires by his doings, viz. merits, goods, titles, etc." --Wieger.
Only the highest leaves are left in the simple form 业.
Some scholars believe 业(業) to have been a picture of a musical instrument, not a plant (Henshall).
The fact that 叶(葉) yè 'leaf' sounds the same seems to be coincidental, since the ancient pronunciations had different initial consonants (*ng- vs. *d-). The Cantonese pronunciations are also different: 业 yihp; 叶 hihp.
