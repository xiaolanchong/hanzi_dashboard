The full form 萬 is a picture of a scorpion (claws at the top). It was borrowed for the word wàn 'ten thousand' which happened to sound like an ancient word for scorpion.
The simple form 万 is at least as old as the Hàn dynasty. 万 could be a simplification of 萬, or it might just be 一 (yī) 'one' over 人 (rén) 'person'; compare 千 (qiān) 'thousand'.
万 is pronounced Mò in the surname 万俟 Mòqí.
