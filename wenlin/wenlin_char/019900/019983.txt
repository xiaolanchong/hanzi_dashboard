"This character is considered by some philologists as a derivative of 正. This is a mistake. It is a primitive, representing a woman sitting; 一 is the girdle; on the left, the seat; on the right, an apron that hides the fore and lower part of the body. By extension, to conceal, to hide, retreat, confinement, screened, out of view" --Wieger.
