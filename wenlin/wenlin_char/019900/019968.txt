A single horizontal stroke, symbolizing the number 1.
The tone (yī, yí, or yì) depends on the following syllable. By itself, or at the end of a phrase, 一 is pronounced yī (first tone). Before a fourth tone syllable, 一 is pronounced yí (second tone, as in 一定 yídìng). Before any other syllable, 一 is pronounced yì (fourth tone, as in 一些 yìxiē). Usually these tone changes are not indicated in pinyin, and the syllable is written with the first tone: yī. Thus, the dictionary has yīdìng and yīxiē, but these should be pronounced yídìng and yìxiē.
一 yī is the first of the 214 radicals.
As a stroke type, a horizontal stroke 一 is called héng (横).
