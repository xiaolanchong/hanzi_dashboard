---- 丐 [gài] (乞丐 qǐgài) beggar
丐 ⁴gài {E} v. 〈wr.〉 beg ◆b.f. beggar 乞丐 qǐgài*
Originally composed of 人 (rén) 'person' and 兦(亡 wáng) 'run away'. The modern form is thoroughly distorted. The form 匃, in which 人 has changed to 勹, and 亡 still has its old form 兦 (入 enter a 𠃊 hiding place) still survives as part of 曷 hé, in which it is phonetic.
