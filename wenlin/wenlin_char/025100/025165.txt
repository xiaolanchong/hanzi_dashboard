Said to depict a plant sprouting through the ground; there are other equally dubious interpretations. 材 cái 'material' and 财(財) cái 'wealth' are etymologically the same word as 才 cái 'talent'.
才 is traditionally listed under 手 (shǒu 'hand') radical 64.
A variant complex form is 纔 (only for the adverb, 'just, then').
