==== 扌 [shǒu] (radical 64, component: 'hand', from 手 shǒu. 提手旁 tíshǒupáng)
No single-syllable words currently in dictionary.	add new s.s.w.
A slightly abbreviated version of 手 shǒu 'hand', used only as a component. Commonly known as 提手旁 tíshǒupáng 'rising-hand-component', maybe for two reasons: because 提 tí contains 扌, and because the last stroke in 扌 is  a rising stroke (提 tí).
