From 音 (yīn) 'sound' and 戈 (gē) 'weapon'. 戠 occurs only as a component in other characters, and then only among full form characters. Among simple form characters, 戠 is always replaced by 只 zhǐ. The meaning was 'officer':
"The man with 戈 a lance who 音 commands" --Karlgren(1923).
Then 耳 (ěr) 'ear' was added, producing the modern character 職, whose simple form is 职.
