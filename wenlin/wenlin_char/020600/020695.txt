xxxx 僗(S) [láo] (呆僗) stupid; (=勞)  [lào]
僗[] ⁷láo char. 呆 dāiláo
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form :) From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 劳(勞) láo phonetic.
The simplified form  is not in Unicode 6.0. It appears in the ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary (DeFrancis 2003, print edition), and in 《形音義規範字典》.
《汉语大字典》 says (of the Full form, it doesn't include the simple form) that  can be a variant of 劳, and is also an auxiliary particle in terms of abuse such as 囚, 馋, 呆.
