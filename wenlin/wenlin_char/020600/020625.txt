(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 杰:) From 木 (mù) 'tree' and 灬(火 huǒ) 'fire'.
The full form 傑 is from 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 桀 jié phonetic.
The two forms 杰 and 傑 have long been interchangeable; 杰 is now standard in Mainland China, while 傑 is used more often in Taiwan (where 杰 is mostly limited to use in people's names).
