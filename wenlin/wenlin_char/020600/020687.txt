From 亻(人 rén) 'person' and 象 xiàng 'appearance'. Etymologically the same word as 象. (According to Karlgren, the meaning was extended from elephant, to ivory, to figure cut in ivory, to image.) 像 and 象 have been interchangeable in some usages since ancient times. From 1964 to 1986, 像 was officially treated as an obsolete variant of 象. In 1986 the standard was changed, and now 像 is supposed to be used for the verb 'resemble' and in many compounds. Generally 像 is used in terms for things made by human beings (like 肖像 xiàoxiàng 'portrait'), while 象 is used in terms with more natural or abstract meanings (like 现象 xiànxiàng 'phenomenon').
