(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 达:) From 大 dà phonetic and 辶(辵 chuò) 'go'.
The full form 達 has 土 over 羊 in place of 大. Actually this 土 was originally 大 dà. An obsolete character 羍 dā 'lamb' (大 dà phonetic over 羊 'sheep') was phonetic in 達. But the simple form, with just 大, seems to be older than the full form.
