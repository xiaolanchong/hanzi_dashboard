---- 遨 [áo] 遨游 áoyóu roam, travel
遨 ²áo {E} v. 〈wr.〉 roam
From 敖 áo 'stroll' and 辶(辵 chuò) 'go'.
敖 áo originally meant 'stroll, saunter'. Then 敖 was borrowed for a
surname, and 遨 áo was formed with the addition of 辵. The last stroke of 敖 changes from  (nà) to 丶 (diǎn) when 敖 is combined with 辶, to improve the appearance (otherwise two  strokes would come together in the lower right corner, which is regarded as unaesthetic according to 汉子正字手册).
