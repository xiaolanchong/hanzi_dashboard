(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 闲:) From 门(門 mén) 'door' and 木 (mù) 'tree'. Why do we see a 木 tree through the 門 door? We might also see the 日 (rì) sun or the 月 (yuè) moon. 闲(閑) xián 'free time' and 间(間) jiān 'space' were both formerly represented by 閒:
"A 門 door through the crevice of which the 月 moonshine peeps in" --Karlgren.
閑 xián once meant 'barrier' ("The 木 wood piece across a 門 door" --Karlgren). Now 闲(閑) is used in place of 閒 for xián 'free time'. This substitution might have been influenced by the function of 木 (mù) 'tree' in 休 xiū 'rest'.
