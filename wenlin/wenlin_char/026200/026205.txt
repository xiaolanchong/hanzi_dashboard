2473 晝(S昼) [zhòu] daytime
晝[昼] ²zhòu {E} 〈wr.〉 n. daytime; daylight; day
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 昼:) The bottom, 旦 dàn 'dawn', indicates the meaning (日 sun over 一 horizon). The upper part is 聿 (yù) in the full form 晝, reduced to 尺 (chǐ) in the simple form 昼. Wieger says during the day "it is 日 clear enough to 聿 write", while Karlgren says "interpretation of the upper part uncertain".
Note the similarity between 昼(晝) zhòu and 画(畫) huà in their full forms, the only difference being that 畫 has 田 where 晝 has 日.
