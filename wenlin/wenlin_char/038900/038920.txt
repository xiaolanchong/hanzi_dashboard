(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 须:) From 彡 (shān) 'hair' and 页(頁 yè) 'head'.
"The 彡 hair of the 頁 face" --Karlgren.
須 originally meant 'beard'. It took on additional meanings, and the full form 鬚 was created for the specific meaning 'beard', with the extra component 髟 (biāo) 'hair'.
