(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 页:) Picture of a 人 (rén) person with a big 𦣻 head (like 首 shǒu, but without hair). The word came to mean 'page', maybe because a page number is written at the head (top) of a page (formerly 葉 yè 'leaf' was used for 'page'; then 頁 yè was substituted). But as a component, 页(頁) still means 'head'.
