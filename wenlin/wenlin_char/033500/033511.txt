---- 苧 [zhù] (S苎) 苧麻 zhùmá ramie   [níng] (F薴) limonene
苧[苎] ¹⁸zhù char. 苎麻 zhùmá*
The shape 苧 came about in two different ways, for two unrelated words zhù and níng.
First came 苧 zhù as in 苧麻 zhùmá 'ramie' (a plant of the nettle family). It is composed of 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' and 宁 zhù phonetic. This 宁 zhù (now obsolete, or superceded by 佇 or 伫) had nothing to do with 寧 níng. Compare 貯(贮) zhù 'store'.
Second, 苧 níng is the simple form of 薴 níng 'limonene' (a word borrowed from English).
