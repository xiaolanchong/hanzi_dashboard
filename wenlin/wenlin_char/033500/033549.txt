Originally from 羊 over 包, according to 说文:
"自急敕也從羊省從包省從口口猶慎言也從羊羊與義善美同意凡苟之屬皆從苟。"
However, 茍 is listed under the grass radical 艹 in the 康熙 dictionary.
Not to be confused with 苟 gǒu, the top of which really is 艹(草) cǎo 'grass'.
茍 appears to have been a signific component in 敬 jìng (as in 尊敬 zūnjìng 'respect').
