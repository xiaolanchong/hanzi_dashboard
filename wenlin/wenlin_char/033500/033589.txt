---- 茵 [yīn] mattress
茵 ⁸yīn b.f. mattress; (fig.) carpet 茵庇 yīnbì 绿茵 ²lǜyīn
From 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' and 因 yīn ('cause'). 因 is not simply phonetic in 茵; in fact 因 is believed to have been the original form of 茵 'mattress', depicting a 大 person lying on a 囗 mattress. When 因 was borrowed for the homophonous abstract word yīn 'cause', the original character was enlarged by 艹(草 cǎo) 'grass' to represent the original meaning 'mattress'.
