1615 脉(F脈) [mài] vein; pulse; 山脉 mountain range  [mò] 脉脉 mòmò lovingly
脉[脈] ⁴mài {E} n. ①arteries and veins ②pulse ③vein of leaves or insect wings
脉[脈] ¹²mò {E} char. 脉脉 ²mòmò
From 月(肉 ròu) 'flesh' and 永 (yǒng) 'forever'.
"Veins and arteries, pulse -- 永 continuous flow in 肉 the body" --Karlgren(1923).
The full form 脈 has 𠂢 (the right side of 派 pài) instead of 永. Originally 𠂢 was just 永 yǒng backwards. The two forms 脉 and 脈 seem to be equally old.
