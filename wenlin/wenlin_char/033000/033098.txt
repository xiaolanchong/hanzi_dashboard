2165 腊 [là] (F臘) (腊月) 12th month; 腊肠 sausage  [xī] dried meat
腊[臘] ⁴là {E} b.f. ①solar year-end sacrifice to the gods ②12th lunar month 腊月 làyuè ③cured (fish/meat/etc., usu. prepared in 12th moon) 腊肉 làròu
From 月(肉 ròu) 'meat' and (full form:) 巤 liè phonetic or (simple form:) 昔 (xī) 'dried meat'.
腊(臘) là originally meant the winter sacrifice (of meat) in the twelfth month of the lunar year. One might think that 月 here was yuè 'month', not 肉 ròu 'meat'. Meats like 腊肉 làròu 'bacon' and 腊肠 làcháng 'sausage' are cured in the twelfth month.
昔 xī represents 龷 strips of meat drying in the 日 (rì) sun. 昔 was enlarged by 月(肉 ròu) 'meat' to produce the character 腊 xī 'dried meat' (now a rare word).
Seemingly 臘 là and 腊 xī had nothing to do with each other (besides having similar meanings), until 腊 became employed as a simplified form for 臘. It isn't clear whether the meaning of 腊 xī influenced this simplification. Compare 猎(獵) liè 'hunt' and 蜡(蠟) là 'wax', where it is also the case that 巤 is replaced by 昔.
