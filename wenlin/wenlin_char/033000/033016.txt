1338 胸 [xiōng] (胸膛, 胸脯) chest; (胸怀) heart, mind
胸 ¹xiōng* {B} n. chest; bosom; thorax ◆b.f. mind; heart 心胸 xīnxiōng 胸有成竹 xiōngyǒuchéngzhú
From 月(肉 ròu) 'flesh' and 匈 xiōng.
The character 匈 (made of 勹 and 凶 xiōng phonetic), already meant 'chest', but was enlarged by 肉 anyway. 勹 is simply 人 (rén) 'person', with room in the middle to show what's inside.
