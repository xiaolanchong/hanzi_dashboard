1190 刑 [xíng] punishment
刑 ⁴xíng {D} b.f. ①punishment; sentence 判刑 pànxíng* 徒刑 ²túxíng ②〈trad.〉 torture; corporal punishment 受刑 ¹shòuxíng
From 开 and 刂(刀 dāo) 'knife'.
The left side 开 is from 井, from 耕 gēng 'plough', abbreviated phonetic. Judging from the modern form and sound, it would seem just as reasonable to regard 井 jǐng as the distorted phonetic. But 井 had a dental initial (ts-), while 耕 and 刑 both had guttural initials (k-, g-). 井 'village, well' was signific in 耕 'plough', not phonetic. No relation to 开(開) kāi 'open'. The situation with 形 xíng 'shape' is the same.
