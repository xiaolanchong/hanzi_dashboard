From 戈 gē phonetic and 刂(刀 dāo) 'knife'.
"To pole a boat" --Karlgren.
The pronunciation huà, with the falling tone, is really a different word; among full form characters it is written 劃, from 畫 huà 'draw' and 刂(刀 dāo) 'knife'. In fact 劃 huà is etymologically the same word as 畫 huà.
"Delimit, mark off; split" --Karlgren.
To further complicate matters, among full form characters some words can be written with either 劃 or 畫: for example, 計劃 or 計畫 jìhuà 'plan'. But among simple form characters, only 计划 is standard (not *计画).
Among simple form characters, 划 is used for both huá and huà.
