"A measure of 十 ten 勺 ladles or 升 pints; a peck; 十升也。勺也。有柄。The ancient forms represent a 勺 ladle and 十 ten. The modern forms are mutilated" --Wieger.
The pronunciation dòu with the meaning 'fight' has a different origin. Its full form is written 鬥.
鬥 depicts a pair of wrestlers in hand-to-hand struggle. 斗 is sometimes added to 鬥 as a phonetic, forming 鬦. Other variants are 鬭 and 鬪.
Among simple form characters, 斗 is used for both 斗 dǒu and 鬥(鬦鬭鬪) dòu.
