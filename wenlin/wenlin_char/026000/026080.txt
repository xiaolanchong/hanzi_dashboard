Picture of a dancer with fancy sleeves or tassels in his or her hands. Now 'dance' is 舞 wǔ, with 舛 two feet added to the bottom. 無 was borrowed for the word wú 'without' (because the words sounded similar). The simple form 无 has co-existed with 無 for thousands of years; 无 is apparently just a simpler depiction of the same dancer.
