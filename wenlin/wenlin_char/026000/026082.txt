The left side  is from the bottom of 食 (shí) 'eat'; it depicts a pot of food. The right side 旡 is a person facing away from the food, already having eaten. Hence 'already'. Compare 即 jí 'immediately', where the person is just about to eat, and 鄉(乡) xiāng 'countryside' where two folks are eating together.
The right side was later re-interpreted as 旡 jì 'belch' (phonetic), which is what you do after eating.
A variant form is 旣.
