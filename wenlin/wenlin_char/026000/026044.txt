於 Yū n. Surname
於 ⁹wū b.f. sigh and exclaim 於穆 ²wūmù ◆char. 於菟 wūtú
於 was formerly used as a variant of the preposition 于 yú, and is still used this way sometimes among full form characters. Among simple form characters, 於 is retained only for the surname Yū and the archaic exclamation wū.
The shape of 於 is of unclear origin.
According to Wieger, 於 "has certainly nothing in common with . It is probably not an arbitrary contraction of 乌 wū. It seems to be a modern sign, invented to be used as a particle expressing the relation that exists between two terms of a proposition. It represents graphically the connection (left side) between 二 two distinct 刀 terms."
Karlgren says the word should be pronounced yū, in the first tone, and that the reading yú for 於 "is due to confusion with the synonymous but not etymologically identical 于".
