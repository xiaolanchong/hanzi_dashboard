101  者 [zhě] one who...; 作者 zuòzhě author; 和平主义者

The explanation is uncertain. According to 王宏源, 者 was the original form of 煮 zhǔ 'cook', and depicted food being placed in a pot.
Anyway, 者 has nothing to do with 老 lǎo 'old', though in some dictionaries 老 is considered to be the radical in 者. The bottom is sometimes written with 白 (bái) instead of 日 (rì).
