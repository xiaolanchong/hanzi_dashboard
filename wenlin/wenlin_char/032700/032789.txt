2231 耕 [gēng] to plough, till
耕 ²gēng {D} v. plow; till
From 耒 (lěi) 'plough' and 井 (jǐng) 'well'.
井 is co-signific, with the meaning 'village'. 井 jǐng is not phonetic: 耕 has a guttural initial, while 井 had a dental initial (ts-). (Palatals j, q, x in Mandarin can be derived either from gutturals g, k, h, or from dentals ts, dz, s.) 耕 gēng is phonetic in 形 xíng and 刑 xíng, after being abbreviated into 井 and then distorted into 开.
