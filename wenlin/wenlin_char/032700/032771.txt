625  考 [kǎo] (考虑 kǎolǜ) consider; (考试 kǎoshì) exam
考 ¹kǎo {B} v. ①give/take test | Wǒmen yào ∼ tāmen de Zhōngwén. 我们要∼他们的中文。 We'll examine their Chinese. ②check; inspect ③study; investigate; verify ◆n. one's deceased father
From 耂(老 lǎo) 'old' and 丂 qiǎo phonetic.
Long ago 考 kǎo meant 'old'. Then 'deceased father' (a meaning still found in dictionaries such as 汉英词典). Now 考 kǎo means to give students examinations and inspect their work, since that is what the old man did. By further extension, 考 kǎo means to study, to ponder.
