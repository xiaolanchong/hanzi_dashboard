2964 趾 [zhǐ] 脚趾 jiǎozhǐ toe
趾 ⁶zhǐ {E} b.f. ①toe 脚趾 jiạ̌ozhǐ 趾骨 ¹zhǐgǔ ②foot 趾高气扬 zhǐgāoqìyáng*
From ⻊(足 zú) 'foot' and 止 zhǐ, which depicts a left footprint. When 止 came to be used for the extended meaning 'stop', the character 趾 was created to represent the original meaning 'foot'.
趾 zhǐ now occurs almost exclusively in the word 脚趾 jiǎozhǐ 'toe'. It is suspiciously homophonous with 指 zhǐ 'finger'. Then there is the word 指头 zhǐtou which means both 'finger' and 'toe'.
The usual word for 'foot' is 脚 jiǎo.
