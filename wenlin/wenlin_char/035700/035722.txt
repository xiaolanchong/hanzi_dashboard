變 is sometimes listed under the radical 攵(攴 pū), and sometimes under 言 yán. (I don't know if it is ever listed under 糸 sī).
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 变:) From (䜌) luán phonetic, and 又 (yòu) 'hand'. In the full form the top 䜌 is composed of 言 words surrounded by two 糸 threads, and the bottom is 攵(攴 pū) 'beat' (often written 夂), not just 又.
How can  luán be phonetic in 变 biàn? "There was an Archaic labial + l (pl-, bl-, ml-) somewhere in this group" --Karlgren(1923).
Compare 挛孪 luán, 恋 liàn, 蛮 mán, 弯 wān.
