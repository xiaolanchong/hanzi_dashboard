郁 is composed of 有 yǒu 'have' (maybe phonetic) and 阝(邑 yì) 'city'. It is the original form of the proper noun Yù. Its original meanings include 'colorful' and 'fragrant', and sometimes 'luxuriant'.
郁 is also used as the simple form of 鬱 yù 'dense foliage; luxuriant; despondent'.
The two characters (or morphemes) are combined in 鬱郁 yùyù 'fragrant'. There seems to be a lot of overlap in the meanings, especially 'luxuriant'. However, they started out as two differently pronounced words: in Cantonese, 郁 ends in -k while 鬱 ends in -t.
