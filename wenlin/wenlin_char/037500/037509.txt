(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 铜:) From 钅(金 jīn) 'metal' and 同 tóng 'together'.
"同 and 銅 are etymologically the same word (not considering the script): tóng 'put together', and the special kind of 'putting together' in an alloyage is marked by an additional specifying signific 金: 銅" --Karlgren.
