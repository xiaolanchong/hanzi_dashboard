From 行 xíng phonetic, 角 (jiǎo) 'horn', and 大 (dà) 'big'.
"A 大 big piece of wood, a yoke fixed to the 角 horns of oxen; 行 is phonetic. A transversal piece, as a beam, etc." --Wieger.
"Yoke of an ox; crosswise; beam of a balance, weigh, appreciate -- the signific is: 大 a large piece across the 角 horns of the ox; the word is cognate to 横" --Karlgren.
Note that 角 is cut off at the bottom so it looks like the top of 鱼.
