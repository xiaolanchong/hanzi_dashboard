Originally from 衣 (yī) 'clothing' and 毛 (máo) 'hair', now written 龶 (four strokes) over  (also four strokes).
"The outside of a garment, outside, external; (outsiders:) relatives of a different family name; (the side that is seen:) conspicuous, to manifest; a signal; a watch, thermometer etc; schedule -- the 毛 hairy side of 衣 the (fur) garment" --Karlgren.
For the meaning 'watch' (as in 'wrist-watch'), the variant form 錶 (with 金 jīn 'metal' added) is sometimes used (but not among simple form characters).
