From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water',  (yǎn) 'banner', and 子 (zǐ 'child').
The  waving motions of a 子 swimmer -- not necessarily a child: the legs are invisible under water; compare 浮 fú 'float'.
Variant forms are 斿 (without 氵, formerly used for the meaning 'ribbon on top of a banner'), and 遊 (with 辶(辵 chuò) 'go' in place of 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water', sometimes used for the meaning 'travel').
