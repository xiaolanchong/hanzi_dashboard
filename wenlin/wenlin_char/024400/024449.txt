From 彳 (chì) 'footstep' and 正 zhèng phonetic.
征 zhēng 'march' is an old character, not a modern simplification. There is another character 徵 zhēng, but among simple form characters, 征 is used for both 征 and 徵. For example, 徵兵 'to recruit troops' is written 征兵 in simple form characters (however, 徵 is still used when pronounced zhǐ).
Versions 1 and 2 of the Wenlin dictionary always used 徵 as the full form of 征, but this was incorrect. For example, 长征 is written 長征 (not *長徵) among full form characters.
