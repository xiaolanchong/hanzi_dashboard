The 彡 three lines represent the shadow, and thus the shape, of an object (as in 影 yǐng). The left side 开 formerly looked like 井 jǐng 'well'. No relation to 开(開) kāi 'open'.
According to Karlgren, 井 here was abbreviated from 耕 gēng phonetic; the same applies to 刑 xíng 'punishment'. Another theory is that the left side 井 (now 开) simply represented a frame, suggesting the meaning pattern, shape, form (--Henshall).
