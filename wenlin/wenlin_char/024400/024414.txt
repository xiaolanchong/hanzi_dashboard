(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 彝:) We treat 彝 as the "simple form" and 彞 as the "full form" only due to the probably accidental fact that one is mapped to the Mainland GB standard and the other to the Taiwan Big5 standard. There is probably no other historical basis for classifying the two forms in this way.
Compare 录 and 彔, where the relation is reversed; but in the case of 录 and 彔 it is clear that they have been chosen intentionally as standard forms in the Mainland and Taiwan, respectively.
