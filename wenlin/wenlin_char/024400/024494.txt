The left side is 彳 (chì) 'footstep', and the right side is 攵(攴 pū) 'strike'. The middle is of uncertain analysis; in the modern character it is 山 shān 'mountain' over 一 yī 'one' over 几 jī 'table'. But originally 几 was 人 (rén) 'person', and 山 may have been the person's hair (compare 长 cháng). 攵(攴) then might represent a hand with a knife, cutting the hair short. (Other theories say the middle was 耑 = 端 duān or 豈 qǐ abbreviated).
彳 'footstep' was added later for the particular meaning that 微 has in 微行 wēixíng -- 'to travel incognito'.
See 徽 huī 'badge', which is from 微 wéi phonetic and 糸 (sī) 'thread'.
