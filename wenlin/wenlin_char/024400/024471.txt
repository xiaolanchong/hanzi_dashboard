Originally 貝 (bèi) 'shell, money' over 寸 (cùn) 'hand': to get your hand on some money.
貝 has become reduced to 旦 (dàn) in the modern form, and 彳 (chì) 'footstep' has been added, meaning that you have to reach the 貝 money before you can 寸 get it (彳 footstep also means 'conduct'; compare 德 dé 'virtue').
得 děi 'must, should' is an extension of the meanings 'get' and 'achieve', where getting money is regarded as a necessity or an obligation.
