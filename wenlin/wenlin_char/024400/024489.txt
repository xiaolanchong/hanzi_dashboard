From 彳 (chì) 'footstep' and 复 fù 'go back'.
"To go back, return; restore; report, answer; repeatedly, again -- etymologically the same word as 复; character tautologically enlarged by 彳" --Karlgren.
Compare 複 fù as in 複雜(复杂) fùzá. Also compare 覆 fù, which is sometimes used interchangeably with 復 with the meanings 'reply' and 'repeat'.
Among simple form characters, 復, 複, and 覆 are all replaced by 复.
