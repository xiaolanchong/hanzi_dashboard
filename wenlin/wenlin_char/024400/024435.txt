==== 彳 [chì] 彳亍 chìchù (书) walk slowly  [fú]
彳 ¹¹chì char. 彳亍 chìchù
彳 is the left half of 行 xíng 'walk', which originally depicted a crossroads. Since 行 has sometimes been re-interpreted as depicting two footprints, 彳 is also often considered to depict a footprint. Where 彳 occurs as a component, it seems to have originated as an abbreviation of 行.
彳 only occurs as a whole character in the rare word 彳亍 chìchù.
As a component, 彳 is sometimes known as 双人旁 shuāngrénpáng, contrasted with亻, which is called 单人旁 dānrénpáng.
彳 is the 60th of the 214 radicals.
