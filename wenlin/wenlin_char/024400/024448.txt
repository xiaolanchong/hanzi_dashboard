331  往 [wǎng] to, toward; 往往 wǎngwǎng often  [wàng]
往 ¹wǎng* {A} v. go toward ◆cov. in the direction of; toward | Nǐ ∼ dōng zǒu sān lǐ jiù dào le. 你∼东走三里就到了。 Go east three miles and you'll be there. ◆b.f. ①past; previous 往事 wǎngshì* ②frequently 往往 ¹wạ̌ngwǎng*
From 彳 'walk' and 王 wáng phonetic; the 丶 dot over 王 is only there to confuse you, nothing to do with 主 zhǔ.
Formerly the pronunciation wàng (falling tone) was standard in some contexts, but now wǎng (dipping tone) is standard wherever 往 occurs. Compare 望 wàng.
