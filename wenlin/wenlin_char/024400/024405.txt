There are various contradictory explanations for the shape of 录, none of them very helpful. The original meaning is obscure. Now 录 is used as the simple form of 錄 lù 'record', the full form of which contains 金 (jīn) 'gold'.
The top is written slightly differently: 彔, not 录, in full form characters such as 綠錄剝祿 (but there are variant forms 緑録). In simple form characters the shape is 录 (绿剥禄 etc.).
