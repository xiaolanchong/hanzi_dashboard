The full form 報 is from 幸 and 𠬝. In the simple form 报, 幸 is replaced by 扌(手 shǒu 'hand').
幸 in 報 derives from an obsolete character niè 'criminal' (which came to be written the same as 幸 xìng 'luck').
𠬝 is the old form of 服 fú (服务 fúwù 'serve'), depicting a 又 hand subduing a 卩 person.
"Punish; requite, recompense; report, inform; information, news; journal, gazette -- to 𠬝 (govern:) punish a 幸 criminal" --Karlgren.
