折 is an old character, not the result of simplification. Another character 摺 zhé is completely unrelated in origin. 折 and 摺 are different words; they were pronounced differently (折 ending in -t, and 摺 ending in -p), and still are in Cantonese. But in Mandarin they are both now pronounced zhé, and by coincidence both have the meaning 'fold' (折 also has various other meanings). So 摺 tends to be replaced by 折, and 折 is regarded as a "simplified" form of 摺, but historically this isn't accurate. See 摺 zhé.
