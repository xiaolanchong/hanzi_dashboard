(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 没:) From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 殳. The original meaning was to dive under water. The right side 殳 was 回 over , abbreviated to 刀 or  over 又.
"To dive, while 回 turning on one's self, in order to  get something under water, the head being below; 入水有所取也。从在回下。会意。By extension, to disappear, to be no more" --Wieger.
氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' was added later. The right side is usually not differentiated from 殳 as in 投 tóu, etc, though sometimes the 几 is written as 刀 or ⺈.
Another character, 殁 mò 'to die', is etymologically the same word as 没 mò, with 歹 (dǎi) 'die' instead of 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water'.
没 méi is not to be confused with 沿 yán.
