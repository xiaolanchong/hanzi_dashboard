沉 ⁴chēn char. 黑沉沉 hēichēnchēn
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 冗, a phonetic component which also occurs in 忱 chén 'sincere', 枕 zhěn 'pillow', 耽 dān, etc. In these other characters, 冗 is written differently: 冘; but it was originally the same: a 人 person walking out in 冂 spacious places. Usually the top of 人 pokes through 冖, but in 沉, the top of 人 is flattened so it looks like 几.
沉 is also used as a surname, pronounced Shěn, but then it is written like the other characters: 沈 Shěn, although 沉 and 沈 used to be identical. To further complicate matters, there is a very rare and completely unrelated character 冗 rǒng, which means 'superfluous'.
