The full form 匯 is composed of 匚, which represents a hollowed-out log, and 淮 huái phonetic. A variant is 滙, in which 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' has gotten outside of the 匚 log. In the simple form 汇, 隹 is omitted.
"Waters converging to one spot; whirling waters" --Mathews.
"Recipient; confluent; heap; bank draft" --Karlgren(1923).
Another form is 彙, which originally depicted a hedgehog and meant 'hedgehog'. That word disappeared and the character was borrowed for an abstract homophone meaning "collection, series; category, class, kind" (--Karlgren). 彙 and 匯 are both pronounced huì in Mandarin, and both have the meaning "gather together". The simple form 汇 replaces both. In modern unsimplified Chinese, 彙 and 匯 are interchangeable in some words, such as huìjí; but some words are generally written with 彙, such as cíhuì, and others with 匯, such as huìliú and wàihuì.
Sometimes 汇 is interchangeable with 会 (會 huì 'meet'), as in huìhé, huìjí, huìjù, and ²huìyǎn.
