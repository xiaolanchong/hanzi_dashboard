1512 污 [wū] foul; 污染 wūrǎn pollution
污 ²wū {C} b.f. ①dirty; filthy; foul 污水 wūshuǐ ②dirt; filth 粪污 fènwū ③corrupt 贪污 tānwū ④defile; smear 污染 wūrǎn*
From 氵(水 shuǐ) 'water' and 亏(于) yú phonetic.
亏 here is derived from 于 yú, phonetic, rather than 亏(虧) kuī, even though it looks like 亏 kuī in the modern writing. A variant form is 汙.
