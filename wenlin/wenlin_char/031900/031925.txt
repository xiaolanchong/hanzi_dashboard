2903 粵(S粤) [Yuè] 粵語 Yuèyǔ Cantonese; 粵剧 yuèjù Guangdong opera
粵[粤] Yuè {E} n. short name for Guangdong/Guangxi
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 粤:) The top was 奥(奧) ào, 'place of the house gods, mystery', now contracted into 丿 plus 囗 plus 米. The bottom is 丂 (qiǎo) 'exclamation'. The character 粤 was used for a variant of the word 曰 yuē 'speak', then was borrowed for Yuè, the name of 广东(廣東) Guǎngdōng and 广西(廣西) Guǎngxī provinces.
