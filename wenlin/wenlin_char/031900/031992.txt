The modern character for 'silk' is 丝(絲) sī, from 糸 or 纟 doubled.
糸 is the 120th Kangxi radical.
As a component at the left side of a character, 糸 is also written 糹 (full form) or 纟 (simple form). It is sometimes called 绞丝旁 'twisted silk component'.
Pronounced mì, 糸 has the meaning "fine silk" ("細絲" in 说文); however, this mì can probably not be considered a word in modern Chinese, where 糸 is used only as a radical/component.
