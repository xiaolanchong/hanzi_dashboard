2476 糞(S粪) [fèn] excrement, manure
糞[粪] ²fèn {C} n. excrement; dung; droppings ◆v. 〈wr.〉 apply manure
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 粪:) The full form 糞 is 米 over 田 over 共. In the simple form 粪, 田 is left out.
In the seal character, the top was 釆 (biàn), not 米 (mǐ). The middle was a picture of a shovel (reduced to 田 tián, then omitted in the simple form). The bottom 共 (gòng) was  two hands, evidently engaged in shoveling manure, which may be what 釆 represents.
