---- 蜴 [yì] 蜥蜴 xīyì lizard  [xí]
蜴 ³¹yì {E} char. 蜥蜴 ¹xīyì
From 虫 (chóng) 'reptile' and 易 yì phonetic.
Possibly 易 yì is really not phonetic, because 易 itself may have been a picture of a lizard (a chameleon to be precise, hence the modern meanings 'change' and 'easy', because a chameleon changes its color easily). According to this theory, which is roughly two thousand years old, 蜴 is just 易 with 虫 added to show that the original meaning 'lizard' is intended. However, forms of 易 which are roughly three thousand years old don't seem to look at all like a lizard.
