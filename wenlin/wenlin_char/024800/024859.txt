(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 爱:) The top was once 旡 jì 'belch', for obscure reasons; it has become 爫 (zhǎo) 'hand' plus 冖 (mì) 'cover'. Below are 心 (xīn) 'heart' and 夂 (zhǐ) 'walk slowly' (a foot pointing down). Supposedly the word once meant 'to walk on tip-toe' or 'gracious gait'.
In the simple form 爱, the bottom is abbreviated to 友 yǒu 'friend'.
Compare 受 shòu.
