Sometimes 楞 (with 木 'wood') is used instead of 愣, in fact the 汉字正字手册 lists 愣 only as a non-standard variant of 楞.
On the other hand, 新法编排汉语词典 gives 楞 as a variant of 棱 léng, and gives 愣 as the only way to write lèng 'stupified'.
There appears to be nothing about the combination of 罒 over 方 in either Wieger or Karlgren.
There is another character 塄 léng used only in dialects.
