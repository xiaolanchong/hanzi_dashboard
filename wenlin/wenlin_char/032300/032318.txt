(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 绩:) From 纟(糸 sī) 'silk thread' and 责(責) zé phonetic.
"To twist, spin; achieve, finish; achievement, meritorious deed" --Karlgren.
绩 jī still has the meaning 'to twist hempen thread', but this is not a common word.
Formerly the standard pronunciation of 绩 was jī, but jì is now official.
