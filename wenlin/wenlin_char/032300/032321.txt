"Luxuriant vegetation, the 每 plants 糸 twisting into a tangle; 从每,  从糸, 会意。Now 繁, on account of a mistake made by the scribes, says the Glose; 误作繁。" --Wieger.
The character 敏 mǐn 'nimble' was not originally a part of 繁. The scribes tended to add strokes to characters to make them fancier. The 攵 in the upper right-hand corner of 繁 is apparently just decoration. (English spelling has a similar history: for example, the word 'rhyme' was formerly spelled 'rime'.)
