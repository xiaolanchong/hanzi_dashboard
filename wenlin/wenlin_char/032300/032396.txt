(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 续:) 纟(糸 sī) 'silk thread' indicates the meaning of connection, continuity. The right side is not historically derived from 卖(賣) mài 'sell', but from an obsolete character pronounced yù (圥 over 罒 over 貝, which came to be written the same as 賣). It was a phonetic component in 续, and also in 读(讀) dú 'read', 赎(贖) shú 'redeem', etc.
