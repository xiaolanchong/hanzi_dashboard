---- 繭(S茧) [jiǎn] cocoon; callus
繭[茧] ⁶jiǎn(r) {D} n. ①cocoon M:²zhī/ge 只/个 ②callus
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 茧:) The simple form 茧 is composed of 艹(草 cǎo) 'plant' over 虫 (chóng) 'worm'. The full form 繭 also contains 糸 (sī) 'silk' and more strokes of obscure origin.
"Silk cocoon -- from 糸 and 虫; the seal shows that the rest is not 艸 and 巾 but one element, the interpretation of which is uncertain" --Karlgren.
