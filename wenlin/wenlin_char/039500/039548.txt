---- 驼(F駝) [tuo] 骆驼 luòtuo camel  [tuó] 驼背 hunchback; 锅驼机 locomobile
驼[駝] ²tuó {E} v. be hunchbacked ◆b.f. camel 骆驼 luòtuo*
From 马(馬 mǎ) 'horse' and 它 tā phonetic.
The original meaning is 'humpback' or 'hunchback'; according to Karlgren this was one of the meanings of 它 tā 'cobra' (presumably due to the way a cobra bends). A distinct character (though etymologically the same word) is 驮 tuó; don't confuse 驮 with 驼.
