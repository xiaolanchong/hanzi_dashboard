2799 驢(S驴) [lǘ] donkey, ass
驢[驴] ¹lǘ {C} n. donkey; ass ◆s.v. stupid and obstinate
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 驴:) The signific part is 马(馬 mǎ) 'horse'.
The full form 驢 contains 盧 lú phonetic. The simple form contains 户 (hù) in place of 盧 (not 卢 lú as you might expect; the simple form of 盧 is 卢, but as a component, 盧 is simplified to 户 in several common characters including 驴).
