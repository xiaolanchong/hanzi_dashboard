(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 严:) The full form 嚴 is composed of two 口 (kǒu) mouths, and 厂 which is a cliff or a cave, and 敢 gǎn phonetic. The simple form 严 is drastically abbreviated.
敢 gǎn 'dare' depicts someone 攵 attacking a 熊 bear. An obsolete character formed of 厂 over 敢, without the 口口, was also pronounced yán. According to Karlgren it meant "lofty mountain".
"To attack a bear in its 厂 cavern, which operation does not go without 口口 cries and howlings... a severe injunction of a superior made, in the Chinese way, with great cries" --Wieger.
