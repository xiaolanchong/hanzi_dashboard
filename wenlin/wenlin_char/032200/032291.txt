(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 县:) Picture of a 首 (shǒu) head hanging upside down on a rope tied to a tree. The tree disappeared thousands of years ago, and the 系 (xì) rope has disappeared from the simple form 县.
"To 系 bind, hang up 首 the head (inverted) of a criminal... suspend, hang up; ... (appendix, i.e.) subprefecture, district; sub-prefect, district-magistrate" --Karlgren.
Now 悬(懸) xuán means 'hang'.
