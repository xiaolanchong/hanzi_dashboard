(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 练:) The full form 練 is composed of 糸 (sī) 'silk' and 柬 jiǎn phonetic. The simple form 练 is 纟 plus . Notice that the component (柬 jiǎn) is not the same as 东(東 dōng 'east').
"To boil and bleach raw silk; purify; to discipline, to drill, to practise" ---Karlgren.
练(練) liàn 'white silk' is etymologically the same word as 炼(煉) liàn 'refine' (as in 锻炼 duànliàn 'exercise'). Compare 拣(揀) jiǎn 'choose'.
