==== 緡(S缗) [mín] string for tying coins together; 1000 coins  [mǐn] [mián] [hún]
緡[缗] ⁵mín 〈wr.〉 n. string for ancient coins ◆m. (for strings of 1000 coins each)
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 缗:) From 纟(糸 sī) 'thread' and 民 mín phonetic over 日 (rì) 'sun'.
(Seemingly no relation to 昬, which is an old variant of 昏 hūn).
