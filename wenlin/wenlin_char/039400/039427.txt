xxxx 騃(S𫘤) [dāi] [ái] (variant of 呆)  [sì] magnificent horse; go fast  [tǎi]
騃/獃[𫘤/呆] ³ái b.f. dull; obtuse; foolish; doltish 𫘤板 áibǎn 痴𫘤 chī'ái 愚𫘤 yú'ái
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 𫘤:) From 马(馬 mǎ) 'horse' and 矣 yǐ phonetic.
Note: 现代汉语词典(1996) treats 𫘤 as standard for the pronunciation ái, and says 呆 should only be pronounced dāi. However, the form 𫘤 was not in the original GB character standard, and wasn't added to Unicode until Unicode 5.2.; the use of 呆 for ái is undoubtedly still widespread. (Are áibǎn and dāibǎn two different words, or two pronunciations of the same word...?) 辞海(1979) identifies 騃 as a variant (异体字) of 呆.
