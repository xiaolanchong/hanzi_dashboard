(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 忧:) "Melancholy, sad; grief, mourning; anxious -- the seal has 𦣻 head, 心 heart, and 夂 walk slowly" --Karlgren(1923).
The simple form 忧 is composed of 忄(心 xīn) 'heart' and 尤 yóu phonetic.
Note that in the full form 憂, the bottom stroke of 𦣻 has been replaced by 冖; the total stroke count is 15, not 16.
