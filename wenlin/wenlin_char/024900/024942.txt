1104 慮(S虑) [lǜ] consider  [lǘ]
慮[虑] ⁵lǜ {E} b.f. ①consider; think over 考虑 kǎolǜ ②worry 忧虑 yōulǜ*
(Explanation from the entry for the simple form 虑:) From 虍 hǔ ('tiger') phonetic and 心 (xīn) 'heart'. The full form 慮 contains 思 (sī) 'thought' rather than just 心.
If 虍 hǔ is phonetic in 虑 lǜ, then "there must have been an Archaic initial guttural + l" says Karlgren. (In other words, the very old pronunciation of 虍 hǔ might have been something like *klu or *hlu.)
Compare 虚 xū 'void', in which 虍 hǔ is definitely phonetic.
