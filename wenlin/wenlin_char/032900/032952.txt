From 月(肉 ròu) 'meat' and 八 (bā) over 十 (shí) 'ten'.
Originally 䏌 plus 十; the components have moved around, 䏌 being split up.
"肸響布也從十從䏌臣鉉等曰䏌振䏌也" --說文。
"肸蠁布也從十從䏌" --段玉裁。
"布散;傳播。振動" --漢語大字典。
Richard Cook (private communication) speculates that the noisy insect was "a cicada, grasshopper or cricket of some sort". 䏌 may have been a phonetic component, or it may indicate the meaning, by extension: 'female flesh'; 'incite,
stimulate, move'; 'scatter'. ("Another SW commentary says 十 shows the extent of 䏌 is great.")
