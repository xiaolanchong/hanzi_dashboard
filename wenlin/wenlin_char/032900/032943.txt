902  肯 [kěn] be willing to; consent; 肯定 kěndìng definitely
肯 ¹kěn* {B} v./aux. be willing/ready to | Tā ∼ bāngmáng ma? 他∼帮忙吗? Is he willing to help?
From 止 (zhǐ) 'stop' over 月(肉 ròu) 'flesh'.
Don't 止 stop, the 肉 flesh is willing.
In reality, the top used to be 冎 'skeleton':
"The 月 flesh, by opposition to the 冎 skeleton. The top of 冎 was already missing in the 小篆 xiǎozhuàn writing. The modern scribes replaced it by a 止 , which is a nonsense, kěn having nothing in common with 止; 著骨肉也。从肉, 从冎省, 会议。今俗字误作肯。The flesh being soft and flexible relatively to the bones that are tough and rigid, hence the derived meanings, to model one's self, to yield, to follow, to be easy tempered, to be inclined, prone to" --Wieger.
